Ambulance transport services involve the use of specially designed and equipped vehicles to transport ill or injured individuals. Ambulance transport may involve the movement of an individual to the nearest hospital for treatment of the individual&rsquo;s illness or injury, non-emergency medical transport of an individual to another location to obtain medically necessary specialized diagnostic or treatment services, or non-emergency medical transport to a hospital or to an individual&rsquo;s home.</p><p>Although wheelchair vans are specially equipped to accommodate physically challenged individuals, they do not have the proper equipment to qualify as an ambulance. Proper equipment may include ventilation and airway equipment, cardiac equipment (monitoring and defibrillation), immobilization devices, bandages, communication equipment, obstetrical kits, infection control, injury prevention equipment, vascular access equipment, and medications.</p><p>An ambulance may be either a ground transportation vehicle, such as a specially equipped truck or van, but may also be a properly equipped aircraft such as a helicopter or airplane or boat. Water ambulances are specially equipped boats. This document specifically addresses only ground transportation-type ambulances.</p><p>In general, an emergency medical condition is defined as a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) so that a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in:</p><ul>	<li>Placing the physical or mental health of the individual afflicted with such condition or, with respect to a pregnant person, the health of the individual or the unborn child, in serious jeopardy;</li>	<li>Serious impairment to such individual&rsquo;s bodily functions; or</li>	<li>Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part of such individual.</li></ul><p>Examples of medical emergencies may include illness or injury such as severe chest pains that might indicate a heart attack, slurred speech or weakness that might indicate a stroke, fracture, hemorrhaging, poisoning, major burns, loss of consciousness or respiratory accidents, convulsions, shock and other acute conditions.</p><p>In a 2018 prospective cohort study by Lau and colleagues, the authors reported on time delays experienced by participants with stroke who arrived in the emergency department and compared ambulance users and non-ambulance users. Those with stroke are recommended to receive tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) within 4.5 hours after the onset of stroke. Of the 102 participants recruited, 48 (47.1%) of them were brought to the emergency department by ambulance. The proportion participants with stroke who arrived within the therapeutic window was higher in ambulance users (64.6%; 31/48) compared to in non-ambulance users (29.6%; 16/54). In this study, after arrival in the emergency department, the time to medical consultation for ambulance users was 8 minutes and that for non-ambulance users was 15 minutes (P&lt;0.001). The time from onset of stroke to medical consultation in the emergency department for ambulance users was 120 minutes, whereas that for non-ambulance users was 1182 minutes (P&lt;0.001). A total of 34 participants were treated with TPA. While this study has limitations including a small sample size and it was conducted in a single center in Hong Kong, the results showed that more participants who used ambulance services arrived within the therapeutic window for stroke intervention and were seen more quickly by emergency department personnel than those who did not arrive by ambulance.</p><p>A 2020 retrospective study by Stewart and colleagues compared the outcomes of transport between helicopter transport and ground transport for inter-facility transfer of persons with trauma to tertiary trauma centers. Looking at the records of 9880 people who had been initially seen at a non-tertiary trauma center, but were then transferred to a tertiary trauma center, the authors reported on mortality at 72 hours and within the first 2 weeks after arriving at the tertiary trauma center. For those transferred by helicopter, the mean distance between the facilities was 96.7 miles with a mean distance of 69.9 miles for those transferred by ground ambulance. The helicopter transport group showed a decreased 72-hour mortality only for the individuals transferred less than 90 miles. There were no significant differences in mortality for helicopter transport greater than 90 miles, and no significant differences in mortality at 2 weeks for either transport modality.</p><p>In 2021, Kunte and colleagues reported on whether air or ground transport led to faster delivery times in interhospital transfer and direct-from-scene transfer of individuals with ischemic stroke to a comprehensive stroke center. In this retrospective review, there were four cohorts: transfer air (n=47), transfer ground (n=68), scene air (n=40) and scene ground (n=50). Three time periods were looked at within the transport process: alarm to emergency medical services (EMS) arrival, EMS arrival to EMS departure, and EMS departure to comprehensive stroke center arrival. Median alarm to EMS arrival time was 27.5 minutes for transfer air, 15.5 minutes for transfer ground, 22 minutes for scene air, and 10 minutes for scene ground. Total on scene time was represented by EMS arrival to EMS departure. Median EMS arrival to EMS departure time was 13 minutes for transfer air, 14 minutes for transfer ground, 7.5 minutes for scene air, and 12 minutes for scene ground. In order to evaluate EMS transfer time not associated with actual travel time, the authors measured the amount of time it took EMS to respond to alarms and prepare the individual for transfer. Those in the transfer cohort had a median alarm to EMS departure of 39 minutes versus 31 minutes for those in the scene cohort. Also in the transfer cohort, transfer air had a median alarm to EMS departure of 44 minutes versus 36 minutes for transfer ground. For those being transported from the scene, scene air median alarm to EMS departure time was 37.5 minutes compared to 25 minutes for scene ground noting air transport had longer EMS time before departure compared to ground transport. Modified Rankin score was used at 90 days after treatment to quantify functional outcomes. There were no significant differences in scores between the groups. The authors did not report whether outcomes were improved. In transporting individuals either between facilities or from scenes, some variables cannot be accounted for such as weather and traffic at the time of transfer.</p><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>References</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p><strong>Peer Reviewed Publications:</strong></p><ol>	<li>Galvagno SM Jr, Haut ER, Zafar SN, et al.
