These pants are attached to an air compression system and electrocardiogram (ECG). The compressor works in conjunction with the ECG to trigger the compressor to inflate or deflate the air bladders in a sequential manner, coordinated with the diastolic (resting) phase of heart function. The sequential compression begins near the feet and progresses towards the torso in order to force blood out of the lower extremities and back into major blood vessels and the heart. This acts to increase blood pressure in the aorta during the diastole, increasing blood delivery to the coronary arteries and the heart muscle.</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom:8px">EECP is used to treat angina, a condition characterized by chest pain due to insufficient blood flow to the heart. Treatment with EECP is intended to provide symptomatic relief of angina, improve blood flow to blood-deprived areas of heart muscle, and to improve a person&rsquo;s level of physical activity. Additionally, EECP is believed to enhance the development of new blood vessels in the heart and increase flow through existing coronary blood vessels. A course of treatment typically includes 35 hours of EECP performed in 1- to 2-hour sessions at a time in the physician&rsquo;s office. EECP is not intended as a first-line therapy for angina, and is reserved for treating cases of angina which do not respond to medical and/or surgical therapy.</p><p>The use of EECP for the treatment of disabling, chronic, stable angina in people who are not suitable candidates for surgical intervention has been established in the medical evidence. Several large-scale prospective studies evaluating the efficacy of EECP in people with chronic stable angina demonstrate significant improvements in anginal symptoms, myocardial perfusion, and output (Arora, 2002; Arora, 1999; Lawson, 2000; Loh, 2008; Soran, 2006; Urano, 2001; Weisfogel, 2001). One randomized, sham-controlled trial demonstrated significant improvement after 12 months of treatment for people who underwent a single 35-hour course of EEPC. In this study treatment-group, subjects reported significant improvements compared to sham treated individuals in all nine quality of life scales included on the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 health survey, including the activities of daily living, ability to work, bodily pain, and others (Arora, 2002). Loh and colleagues reported on the results of a large case series study with 1427 participants who underwent a single course of 35 one-hour EECP treatments (2008). The authors reported that immediately following the treatment series, the proportion of subjects dropping at least one class on the Canadian Cardiovascular angina Classification system (CCS) was 77.9% and that 38.0% had dropped by 2 CCS classes. Based on participant reports, 76% of subjects experienced at least a 50% reduction in the frequency of angina symptoms. These improvements were durable and were noted to continue through to the three-year follow-up visits. There was also a significant decrease in calcium channel blocker and long-acting nitrate use at all follow-up points.</p><p>Study exclusion criteria for use of EECP included contraindications to individuals with: severe aortic insufficiency, arrhythmia, bleeding diatheses, congestive heart failure, deep vein thrombosis, varicosities or stasis ulcers, peripheral vascular disease or phlebitis, pregnant women or women of childbearing potential who do not employ a reliable contraceptive, receiving warfarin (Coumadin) therapy, severe hypertension (greater than 180/110 mmHg, stroke and unstable angina.</p><p>EECP has also been studied for the treatment of congestive heart failure. In 2002, Soran and colleagues reported on a feasibility study of EECP, as a treatment for congestive heart failure in 26 subjects. In this uncontrolled study, the subjects were treated with 35 daily, one-hour sessions and followed for 6 months after completion of the course of therapy. The study suggests that the treatment was safe and well tolerated.</p><p>Results from the PEECH trial (Prospective Evaluation of EECP in Congestive Heart Failure) have been published (Feldman, 2006). The article discusses the 6-month outcomes of the PEECH trial which was a randomized controlled trial of 187 subjects with mild to moderate symptoms of heart failure. Participants were selected to receive either EECP and pharmacologic therapy or pharmacologic therapy alone. At 6 months, the study identified significant improvement in the EECP group compared to the control group in exercise time (also 35% increased exercise time by at least 60 seconds compared to 25% of controls), and NYHA functional class. No significant differences were identified in peak volume oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>), respiratory exchange rate, or measurements on the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure or Borg scales. While the results of this study are promising, small numbers of participants (71 subjects completed the EECP regime), a high dropout rate in the experimental group due to adverse experiences (24% vs. 14% in the control group), lack of blinding which the authors acknowledge may have allowed for a placebo effect and lack of a sham treatment group, hinder the value of the study results. Finally, a subgroup analysis of the study data found that significant improvement in exercise time was seen only in the subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy (approximately 40 seconds compared to controls), and not in those with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.</p><p>In a separate report, Abbottsmith and colleagues report on a subgroup analysis of the PEECH trial (2006). Their report focused on PEECH participants greater than 64 years of age. The study results indicated that at 6 months, exercise responder rate and peak VO<sub>2 </sub>were significantly improved compared to the control group. NYHA classification was significantly improved compared to controls at 3 months follow-up but not at 6 months and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure scores were not found to be significantly different. Again, while these results are promising, the same limitations of the larger PEECH trial affect these subgroup results. The authors warn that, as a subgroup analysis, their data should be interpreted with caution, but that it may be of benefit in identifying subgroups in which additional research should be targeted. Data from a larger, blinded randomized controlled trial are needed to validate the PEECH trial findings.</p><p>In August 2020, the FDA approved the Enhanced External Counterpulsation Device Plus Omay-A (Omay Med Technologies Co., Ltd. Nanshan District, Shenzhen, China) through the 510K approval process. The device is approved for the treatment of chronic stable angina that is refractory to optimal anti-anginal medical therapy without the option for revascularization, as well as for use in healthy individuals to provide improved vasodilation and increased blood flow, with the oversight of a healthcare professional.</p><p>In 2014, the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) /American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS)/Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association (PCNA)/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI)/Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) focused update of the Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients With Stable Ischemic Heart Disease (SIHD) issued recommendations for EECP for relief of refractory angina in individuals with SIHD (Class IIb Level of Evidence B). A class IIb, level of evidence B recommendation indicates the procedure/treatment may be considered. The benefit is equal to or greater than the risk. Additional studies with broad objectives are needed, and additional registry data would be helpful. The usefulness/efficacy is less well established, and greater conflicting evidence from single randomized trials or nonrandomized studies exists. (Fihn, 2014)</p><p>The 2015 ACC/AHA/SCAI focused update to the 2011 practice guideline for percutaneous coronary intervention, does not address EECP procedure/treatment. (Levine, 2016)</p><p>In 2022, the ACC/AHA published the updated key data elements and definitions for chest pain and acute myocardial infarction: a report of the AHA/ACC Joint Committee of Clinical Data Standards.
