AMD affects the macula located in the center of the retina. The macula has the highest photoreceptor concentration and is where visual detail is discerned. Wet AMD occurs with the pathological formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) behind the retina. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid displacing the macula from its normal position at the back of the eye and distorting central vision as a result. Wet AMD is also known as advanced AMD.</p><p>The IMT is currently the only intraocular telescope system that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Singer, 2012). This device does not treat AMD directly; it works around the AMD. Incoming images are expanded onto the still functioning part of the macula. The device is about the size of a pea (3.6 mm diameter; 4.4 mm length) and is surgically inserted through an incision in the cornea, and rotated into place. The IMT has two mirrors that are used to enhance and magnify images. Although photoreceptors in the macular area are damaged by wet AMD, the peripheral photoreceptors remain intact. The purpose of the IMT is to magnify an image so that a much larger picture is projected onto the peripheral retina allowing the peripheral photoreceptors to pick it up, so that the image can be seen by the individual. Only one eye can be implanted so that the other eye serves to pick up peripheral vision. Visual rehabilitation and occupational therapy are necessary to adapt to the device, therefore, it is crucial that appropriate candidates are selected for the treatment. There are also concerns with side effects, such as corneal edema, as well as the need for a corneal transplant (1 out of 25), due to damage caused by the IMT. However, for many age 65 years and older, IMT represents an opportunity to restore vision before it is lost completely.</p><p>The FDA approved the IMT in July, 2010 for monocular implantation to improve vision in individuals 75 years of age or older with stable, severe to profound vision impairment caused by bilateral central scotomas associated with end-stage AMD. Approval was granted to VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies Inc. (Saratoga, California), which is now known as Samsara Vision, Inc. In October 2014, the FDA expanded the age limit for the IMT from 75 to 65 years of age or older.</p><p>Additionally, the FDA recommends that individuals:</p><ul>	<li>have retinal findings of geographic atrophy or disciform scar with foveal involvement, as determined by fluorescein angiography;</li>	<li>have evidence of visually significant cataract (greater than or equal to Grade 2);</li>	<li>agree to undergo pre-surgery training and assessment (typically 2 to 4 sessions) with low vision specialists (optometrist or occupational therapist) in the use of an external telescope sufficient for patient assessment and for the patient to make an informed decision;</li>	<li>achieve at least a 5-letter improvement on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart with an external telescope;</li>	<li>have adequate peripheral vision in the eye not scheduled for surgery;</li>	<li>agree to participate in postoperative visual training with a low vision specialist.</li></ul><p>The initial FDA approval was based on 1-year results of a prospective, open-label, multi-center clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the IMT (Hudson, 2006). A total of 217 individuals, 55 to 93 years of age (mean age, 76 years) with AMD and moderate to profound bilateral central visual acuity loss (20/80 to 20/800) resulting from bilateral untreatable geographic atrophy, disciform scars, or both were enrolled. Eleven eyes did not receive the device because the procedure was terminated. The IMT was implanted monocular (in one eye) in the capsular bag after lens extraction. Fellow eyes (contralateral) were not implanted to allow for peripheral vision and served as controls. Study subjects participated in six visual rehabilitation visits after surgery. The majority of those subjects (90%) met or exceeded the visual acuity endpoint defined as an improvement in 2 lines or more in either near or distance best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at the 1-year follow-up. Change in visual acuity was not related to lesion type. Mean endothelial cell density (ECD) loss at 3 months was 20% and 25% at 12 months. The decrease in ECD was correlated with post-surgical edema, and there was no evidence that endothelial cell loss was accelerated by ongoing endothelial trauma after implantation. The authors concluded that, &ldquo;The population of patients in this investigation experienced clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in both visual acuity and quality of life.&rdquo;</p><p>As a condition of approval, the FDA required the manufacturer, VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies Inc., to conduct two post-approval studies. In 2008, Hudson and colleagues reported results of follow-up evaluations continuing at 18 and 24 months. Main outcome measures included BCVA change from baseline, ECD and morphometry, and incidence of complications. Data from 174 (92.6%) of 188 available subjects were analyzed. Overall, 103 (59.5%) of 173 telescope-implanted eyes gained 3 lines or more (doubling of visual angle) of BCVA compared with 18 (10.3%) of 174 fellow control eyes (p&lt;0.0001). Mean BCVA improved 3.6 lines (standard deviation [SD], 1.9 lines) and 2.8 lines (SD, 2.3 lines) from baseline in eyes with the 3X and 2.2X device models, respectively. Mean ECD stabilized through 2 years, with 2.4% mean cell loss occurring from 1 to 2 years. There was no significant change in coefficient of variation or percentage of hexagonal endothelial cells from within 6 months to 2 years after surgery. The most common complication was inflammatory deposits. Long-term results showed that the BCVA improvement demonstrated at 1 year was also maintained at 2 years.</p><p>A second post-approval study (Boyer and colleagues, 2015) followed participants to 60 months and reported long-term safety and efficacy outcomes. Additionally explored was whether younger subjects had similar or better outcomes after IMT implantation as compared to the older participants. A total of 2 subgroup analyses were performed consisting of group 1 (n=70; subject age 65 to less than 75 years) and group 2 (n=127; subject age 75 years or older). The mean best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) improvement from baseline to 60 months was 2.41 &plusmn; 2.69 lines in all subjects, with 2.64 &plusmn; 2.55 lines in group 1 and 2.09 &plusmn; 2.88 lines in group 2. At the 60-month final follow-up visit, 62% maintained a significant 2-line BCDVA improvement. Significantly higher quality of life scores and fewer adverse events were reported for group 1. Study limitations included a small number of participants as not all original participants chose to continue in the extension study. The authors also reported that, for a small number of participants initially enrolled (n=20) but too small for inclusion in data analysis, &ldquo;The IMT performed as well in the 20 patients aged 55-65 years as in those aged 65-75 years.&rdquo;</p><p>Currently available evidence in the peer reviewed literature supports the use of the FDA approved IMT, in terms of clinical effectiveness and safety, to improve severe to profound vision impairment caused by end-stage AMD when specific requirements are met.</p><p>Some additional information from the FDA is as follows:</p><p><strong>Contraindications per product labeling information (2010):</strong></p><p>Implantation of the intraocular telescope is contraindicated in individuals:</p><ul>	<li>with Stargardt&#39;s macular dystrophy;</li>	<li>with central anterior chamber depth (ACD) &lt; 3.0 mm; measurement of the ACD should be taken from the posterior surface of the cornea (endothelium) to the anterior surface of the crystalline lens;</li>	<li>with the presence of corneal guttata;</li>	<li>who do not meet the minimum age and ECD requirements;</li>	<li>with cognitive impairment that would interfere with the ability to understand and complete the Acceptance of Risk and Informed Decision Agreement or prevent proper visual training/rehabilitation with the device;</li>	<li>who have evidence of active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) on fluorescein angiography or treatment for CNV within the past six months;</li>	<li>with any ophthalmic pathology that compromises the patient&#39;s peripheral vision in the fellow eye;</li>	<li>with previous intraocular or cornea surgery of any kind in the operative eye, including any type of surgery for either refractive or therapeutic purposes;</li>	<li>who have prior or expected ophthalmic-related surgery within 30 days preceding IMT implantation;</li>	<li>with a history of steroid-responsive rise in intraocular pressure (IOP), uncontrolled glaucoma, or preoperative IOP &gt; 22 mm Hg, while on maximum medication;</li>	<li>with known sensitivity to post-operative medications;</li>	<li>who have a history of eye rubbing or an ocular condition that predisposes them to eye rubbing;</li>	<li>in whom the planned operative eye has:	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">		<li>Myopia &gt; 6.0 D</li>		<li>Hyperopia &gt; 4.0 D</li>		<li>Axial length &lt; 21 mm</li>		<li>A narrow angle, i.e., &lt; Schaffer grade 2</li>		<li>Cornea stromal or endothelial dystrophies, including guttata</li>		<li>Inflammatory ocular disease</li>		<li>Zonular weakness/instability of crystalline lens, or pseudoexfoliation</li>		<li>Diabetic retinopathy</li>		<li>Untreated retinal tears</li>		<li>Retinal vascular disease</li>		<li>Optic nerve disease</li>		<li>A history of retinal detachment</li>		<li>Intraocular tumor</li>		<li>Retinitis pigmentosa;</li>	</ul>	</li>	<li>in eyes in which both haptics cannot be placed within the capsular bag during surgery, the intraocular telescope should be removed and replaced with a conventional intraocular lens (IOL); sulcus fixation of either one or both haptics increases the risk of severe endothelial cell loss and corneal transplant.</li></ul><p><strong>Warnings per product labeling information (2010) include the following:</strong></p><ul>	<li>Patients undergoing intraocular telescope implant may be at risk of developing persistent unresolved corneal edema (corneal edema that continues), persistent vision-impairing corneal edema (continuing corneal edema leading to a loss of BCDVA &gt; 2-lines from baseline level at last available visit) and may need corneal transplantation.

However, it has not received FDA approval or clearance for marketing in the U.S.</p><p>At this time, published data for the SING IMT device is limited. Toro and colleagues (2023) conducted a non-comparative retrospective study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the device in individuals with disciform scars or geographic atrophy at baseline who had stable but severe to profound vision impairment caused by central scotomas associated with end-stage AMD. The individuals had monocular implantation and were followed for 3 months. The outcomes measured were BCDVA, best-corrected distance near visual acuity (CDNVA), incidence of complications, loss of ECD, IOP, and ACD. A total of 24 subjects were included. Outcomes were measured at baseline and postoperatively at day 1, day 15, month 1, and month 3. All the individuals were Caucasian and ranged between 69-91 years old (median age: 76 years). At baseline, all measured outcomes (BCDVA, CDNVA, IOP, ECD and ACD) were comparable between the study and untreated control eyes. At the 1-month and 3-month follow-ups, the mean ACD in the study eyes was not significantly different from the baseline. Regarding IOP, there was a significant decrease (p&lt;0.05) in the study eye group from baseline to the 3-month follow-up, however, no between-group differences were reported. There was a statistically significant increase in the study eye group in regard to CDVA and CDNVA (p&lt;0.0001 for all) at the 1- and 3-month follow-ups. The authors reported significant ECD loss in the study eye group, however, no p-values were reported. Compared to baseline in the study eye group, at 1 month post-procedure, average ECD loss was 9.6&plusmn;13.3% (p=0.0047) and 10.4&plusmn;13.3% at 3 months (p=0.0025). During the study period, no device malfunctions were reported. Within 30 days of the surgery, 7 subjects had corneal edema, but they all resolved by 2 months post-procedure with pharmacological treatments. A total of 4 subjects had to undergo surgical repositioning of the device due to iris incarceration or iris prolapse. It was noted that almost 70% of the subjects did not report any adverse events but 14 ocular adverse events were reported in 7 subjects (29.17%). The two most common adverse events were each reported by 3 subjects, and they included distorted pupil and inflammatory deposits on the device. No unexpected adverse events were reported and most of the adverse events were resolved with medical or surgical treatments. The authors note that the individuals will continue to be followed and monitored up to 12 months post-procedure. The limitations of this study include low power due to small sample size, short-term follow-up, the retrospective design, and the fact that all the subjects were Caucasian.</p><p>At this time, the available evidence regarding the clinical utility of the SING IMT device is limited. Aside from receiving the necessary regulatory approval from the FDA, further investigation is needed to establish its place in clinical practice.</p><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Definitions</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD): A disease blurring the sharp, central vision needed for &quot;straight-ahead&quot; activities such as reading, sewing, and driving. AMD affects the macula, the part of the eye used for fine detail. In some cases, AMD advances so slowly that people notice little change in their vision and in others, the disease progresses faster and may lead to a loss of vision in both eyes.</p><p>Dry AMD also called atrophic AMD: A form of AMD that involves gradual thinning of the macula which happens in 3 stages: early, intermediate, and late. It usually progresses slowly over several years. Any stage of dry AMD can turn into wet AMD.</p><p>Wet AMD also called advanced neovascular AMD: A less common type of late AMD that usually causes faster vision loss. It involves the formation of abnormal blood vessels in the back of the eye that leak causing damage to the macula.</p><p>Central scotoma: An area of diminished vision corresponding with the point of fixation and interfering with central vision. More commonly known as a blind spot in the center of vision.</p><p>Choroidal neovascularization (CNV): A condition characterized by the development of new blood vessels across the back portion of the eye, which may interfere with vision.</p><p>Disciform scar: A subretinal scar, most often located in the macular area of the eye.</p><p>External telescope: A hand-held or externally worn telescope used to magnify objects.</p><p>Fovea: A pit in the retina of the eye which allows for sharp central vision.</p><p>Geographic atrophy: Is considered late-stage dry AMD.</p><p>Peripheral vision: Vision outside the center of gaze, on the sides.</p><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>References</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p><strong>Peer Reviewed Publications:</strong></p><ol>	<li>Boyer D, Freund KB, Regillo C, et al.
