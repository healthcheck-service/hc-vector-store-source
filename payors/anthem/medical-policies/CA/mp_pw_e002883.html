A prosthetic device can play an important role in rehabilitation when an upper or lower extremity is lost. The standard type of device used after limb loss is a socket-type prosthesis. The use of a bone-anchored prosthetic device such as the Osseointegrated Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees system (OPRA<sup>&trade;</sup>, Integrum, M&ouml;lndal, Sweden) has been proposed as an alternative.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>This document does not address other types of limb prostheses.

The prosthetic socket is the primary and critical interface between the amputee&#39;s residual limb and the rest of the prosthesis (Patern&ograve;, 2018). It is essential for the socket to be well designed and fitted to achieve a comfortable and functional prosthesis with proper load transmission, stability, and control. Socket-related problems such as poor fit, poor biomechanics, and reduced control are significant reasons why some individuals with amputations stop wearing their prostheses. In addition, many users of socket prostheses experience sweating, sores or skin irritation, pain in the residual limb, and other problems related to the fit of the socket that negatively affect their mobility and quality of life. Due to these issues, the socket prosthesis abandonment rate has been estimated at approximately 25-57%.</p><p>Osseointegration has been suggested as an alternative for individuals with limb amputations who cannot tolerate traditional socket prostheses. With osseointegration, a metal implant is anchored into the existing bone so that the prosthesis can be directly attached to the skeleton. Besides eliminating socket-related problems, osseointegration is proposed to improve functionality, range of motion and strength of the limb, as well as enhance proprioception.</p><p>The OPRA implant system received pre-market approval (PMA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2020. The OPRA system consists of three main components: the fixture, the abutment, and the abutment screw. Installation of the system requires two operations 6 months apart, followed by rehabilitation. The first operation involves insertion of the fixture into the residual bone. The second operation involves insertion of the abutment which penetrates through the skin into the implant and is secured with the abutment screw.</p><p>A prospective, single-center, non-randomized cohort study of 51 individuals with transfemoral amputations provided the clinical data supporting the FDA approval (Br&aring;nemark, 2014; Br&aring;nemark, 2019; Hagberg, 2020). Key inclusion criteria were individuals aged 20-70 years with current or expected problems with a conventional prosthesis, or inability to use a prosthesis, full skeletal maturity, normal residual skeletal anatomy, suitability for surgery, and likeliness to comply with treatment and follow-up requirements. Key exclusion criteria were severe peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, skin disease involving the amputated limb, or other diseases that could adversely affect the treatment. The main reasons for amputation were trauma and malignant tumor. On entry to the study, 42 of 51 individuals were using conventional socket prostheses. Of the 9 individuals who did not use a prosthesis, 8 had been unable to obtain a comfortable prosthesis and 1 had a very short amputation stump.</p><p>Functional outcome and health-related quality of life were assessed using two self-report questionnaires, the Questionnaire for Persons with a Transfemoral Amputation (Q-TFA) and the Short-Form (SF)-36 at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the final implantation procedure (Br&aring;nemark, 2014). At 2 years of follow-up, the Q-TFA showed improved prosthetic use, mobility, and fewer problems (all p&lt;0.001). Physical function scores on the SF-36 were also improved (p&lt;0.001). The most frequent complication was superficial infection, occurring 41 times in 28 individuals (rate of infection 54.9%). In 4 individuals, the implant was removed due to loosening (3 aseptic, 1 infection). At 5 years of follow-up (Br&aring;nemark, 2019), the cumulative fixture survival rate was 92%, and the revision-free survival rate was 45%. A total of 34 individuals had 70 superficial infections; 11 individuals had 14 deep infections. Mechanical complications were observed in 15 individuals. The authors concluded that although patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) improved significantly, deep infections and mechanical complications were of concern.</p><p>Hagberg and colleagues (2020) reported results of a 15-year follow-up study of a cohort of 111 transfemoral amputees treated with the OPRA implant system. The survival rate of the fixture was 72% after 15 years. A total of 61 individuals (55%) had mechanical complications resulting in a change of the abutment or abutment screw, while 21 individuals (19%) had six or more events. The mean number of these mechanical complications per individual was 3.3 (SD 5.76). Mechanical complications were more common in individuals with a higher activity grade. Complications due to infection were not considered in this study. The Q-TFA scores at up to 10 years showed significantly more prosthetic use, better mobility, fewer problems, and an improved global situation, compared with baseline. At 15 years, the problem scores and global scores were significantly improved but there were no differences in other areas, possibly due to the reduced number of participants assessed. However, the authors concluded that the number of mechanical complications was a concern and that it will be necessary to &ldquo;improve both the material properties of the implant, as well as to consider restrictions in the physical activity of this group of patients.&rdquo;</p><p>In 2017, Tillander and colleagues reported the osteomyelitis risk in individuals with transfemoral amputations treated with osseointegration prostheses. In a group of 96 treated individuals, implant-associated osteomyelitis was diagnosed in 16 individuals, corresponding to a 10-year cumulative risk of 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.33). Implants were extracted from 10 individuals with a 10-year cumulative risk of 9% (95% CI, 0.04-0.20). Prosthetic use was temporarily impaired in 4 of the 6 individuals with infection who did not undergo implant extraction. The overall risk of implant-related osteomyelitis increased with time since implantation. This was deemed to be a major problem as the osseointegration method is intended to be a lifetime solution for prosthetic support.</p><p>Several other types of osseointegration implant systems have been developed but are not yet approved by the FDA (Hoellwarth, 2020). These devices use either press-fit technology (Integral Leg Prosthesis [ILP], Osseointegrated Prosthetic Limb [OPL], Percutaneous Osseointegrated Prosthesis [POP], Intraosseous Transcutaneous Amputation Prosthesis [ITAP]) or cross-pins (Compress Device) to anchor the implant to the bone. In a systematic review of complications of bone-anchored prostheses, Atallah and colleagues (2018) reported that major complications (for example implant infection, implant loosening and intramedullary device breakage) seem to occur less frequently in individuals with press-fit implants compared to those with OPRA or Compress devices. However, peri-prosthetic bone fracture was only reported in individuals with press-fit implants or the Compress device, and not in those with screw type implants.</p><p>Hebert and colleagues (2017) conducted a systematic review of clinical outcomes of osseointegration for lower limb amputation. A total of 14 studies involving OPRA, ILP and OPL devices were included. A comprehensive summary of patient selection criteria was detailed including age &gt;18 years and &lt;70 years, ability to comply with the treatment program and follow-up, and qualifying problems with conventional socket prostheses. Notable contraindications, in addition to those described by Br&aring;nemark (2014) above, included mental illness or disabling psychiatric disorder, and osteoporosis. The most common complications of osseointegration were infection and soft tissue irritation at the stoma. It was concluded that, over time, changes in implant design, surgical technique, perioperative and postoperative care, and rehabilitation protocols have resulted in improvements in functional outcomes and health-related quality of life, and reduction in rates of complications.</p><p>In summary, despite some risks such as mechanical failure and infection, osseointegrated implants are a viable alternative to improve mobility and quality of life for appropriately selected individuals with limb amputations who cannot tolerate traditional socket prostheses.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Background/Overview</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>Approximately 185,000 individuals undergo a lower limb amputation in the United States each year according to the Amputee Coalition of America.
