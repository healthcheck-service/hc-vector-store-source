The orally administered capsules are indicated for treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults after failure of at least a 1-month trial of laxative therapy. The efficacy and safety of vibrating capsules in treating chronic constipation has been evaluated in randomized, controlled trials (RCTs).</p><p>Zhu and colleagues (2022) conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a vibrating capsule. Individuals with functional constipation were recruited from an outpatient clinic and were randomized to receive vibrating (n=53) or sham (n=53) capsules. Eligible individuals had self- reported symptoms of less than 3 complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week for the past 3 months with onset of symptoms at least 6 months prior to study enrollment. Participants also reported the presence of additional symptoms listed on the Bristol Stool Form Scale during more than 25% of defecations. Following a 2-week run-in period, participants took a capsule every 3 or 4 days for a total of 12 capsules within 6 weeks. Follow-up continued for 4 weeks or until laxatives were used. Responders were defined as having an increase in at least one CSBM per week over their baseline frequency. There was a significant between-group difference in the response rates: vibrating capsule 64% vs. sham treatment 36%; between group difference 28% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10&minus;45%). There were no significant differences in the proportion of adverse events (AEs) between the groups and there were no cases of capsule retention. Limitations included a shortened treatment period (the recommended treatment regimen is 12 weeks) and no long-term follow-up data.</p><p>A phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT compared the short-term outcomes of individuals who had received either a vibrating or placebo capsule to treat chronic constipation (Rao, 2023). Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 arms, a placebo group (n=149), and 2 active arms with different programmed vibration times (n=163). Participants received capsules 5 days a week for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoints were either the proportion of participants with an increase of 1 or more CSBM per week, or with an increase of 2 or more CSBMs per week in at least 6 of the 8 weeks of the treatment phase. The percentage of participants who met a primary efficacy endpoint was significantly greater in the active treatment groups compared to the placebo group (39.3% compared to 22.1%, p=0.001, and 22.7% compared to 11.4%, p=0.008, respectively, for each efficacy point). There were no reported serious AEs. The authors note that longer duration studies are needed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the capsules.</p><p>In an open label study, Nelson and associates (2017) examined the effect of vibrating and sham capsules on colonic transit time in individuals with functional constipation. An equal number of individuals were randomized to each group (n=12). Individuals in each group underwent a baseline colonic transit measurement and a second colonic transit measurement during the final week of treatment. There were no significant differences between the groups for the slope of progression of the capsule over 48 hours. The decision to use colonic transit as the primary endpoint is questionable as constipation is not well correlated with delayed colonic transit and the majority of individuals with constipation have normal colonic transit (Bharucha, 2013; Nelson, 2017).</p><p>The mechanistic effects of vibrating capsules in chronic idiopathic constipation were evaluated in post hoc analyses of two prospective, adaptive, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and sham-controlled studies (Rao, 2020). The analyses included individuals who received vibrating (n=133) or sham (n=117) capsules. Participants had self-reported constipation symptoms, between 1 and 3 spontaneous bowel movements per week and symptoms were refractory to osmotic and stimulant laxatives for at least 1 month. The study evaluated CSBM response rates in which a response rate was defined as an increase of at least 1 CSBM/week over baseline. Both studies included a 2-week run-in period and an 8-week treatment period, but the vibration session varied. In one study each capsule was programed to vibrate for a single 2-hour session, in the second study each capsule was programmed to vibrate for two 2- hour sessions. There were no differences in CSBM response rates between the treatment and sham groups in either study.</p><p>There is a paucity of evidence to support that ingestible vibrating capsules are a safe and effective treatment of chronic constipation. There is a lack of trial outcomes which show a benefit of active treatment over sham treatments. There are no published studies with long-term follow-up data which demonstrates durable and safe outcomes associated with vibrating ingestible device use over time (Saeed, 2023).</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Background/Overview</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>The reported prevalence of constipation varies greatly depending upon the criteria used and the targeted population, but general consensus estimates prevalence at approximately 8-15% of the population (Palsson, 2020). Prevalence is higher in select populations, including women, minorities, individuals older than 65 years and individuals in a lower socioeconomic status.</p><p>Constipation is classified as either primary or secondary. Primary constipation is frequently defined based upon the Rome IV diagnostic criteria. Primary constipation can be categorized as functional constipation, constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome or defecatory disorders. Functional constipation, also known as idiopathic constipation, is primarily defined by the presenting symptoms. Constipation is associated with fewer than 3 stools/week, straining at stool, a feeling of incomplete evacuation, the need for digital assistance to complete a bowel movement, bloating and hard or lumpy stools. The diagnosis of functional constipation requires that the individual have two or more of the above symptoms which affect more than 25% of their bowel movements for at least 6 months with active symptoms for the past 3 months (Bharucha, 2020).</p><p>The initial treatment of constipation consists of lifestyle changes such as increasing fiber/fluid intake, increasing activity levels and laxatives. Treatment refractory constipation may be treated with medication, such as secretagogue or prokinetic agents, or with biofeedback therapy. Surgery can be considered if other treatments are ineffective. The appropriate surgical intervention is based upon any pathophysiology present and the risk/benefits acceptable to the affected individual (Bharucha, 2020; Paquette, 2016; Włodarczyk, 2021).</p><p>The Vibrant Gastro system is a non-pharmacological, intraluminal &ldquo;mechanical-pill&rdquo; therapy marketed as a treatment of chronic constipation. The system is comprised of a multi-use activation pod and a 1-month supply of disposable drug-free capsules. A capsule is placed in the base unit or pod and is programmed with an activation code via an electromagnetic signal. The activation code determines the time span of vibration sessions and strength of vibrations. Following activation, the capsule is taken orally. Capsules can be used 2-5 times per week. Each capsule should take 1 day to pass through the digestive tract before being expelled. Typically, the device will begin vibrating 8 hours following activation to allow the capsule to reach the colon. The ingestible capsules are typically taken at night so stimulation begins in the morning, possibly normalizing the biologic circadian rhythm (Rao, 2020). Capsule progress can be monitored via a smartphone application. Endoscopy would be needed to remove retained capsules.</p><p>The Vibrant Gastro system is theorized to work in two ways. The ingestible devices may enhance colonic motility by providing direct mechanical stimulation to the intestinal wall leading to the enhanced movement of stool (Zhu, 2022). There is a theory that the human colon is naturally programmed to empty upon awakening in the morning. This biorhythm may be significantly altered in individuals with chronic severe constipation. Rao and associates (2020) note that individuals with constipation report the most bowel movements occurring in the evening hours compared to individuals without constipation who report daytime bowel movements. With extended, consistent use, ingestible devices are hypothesized to resynchronize the biological clock, leading to the restoration of natural bowel movement biorhythm (Rao, 2020).</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Definitions</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>Bristol Stool Form Scale: An ordinal scale of stool consistency types which range from hardest (type 1) to softest (type 7).</p><p>Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement (CSBM): Bowel movement not induced by rescue medication within the prior 24 hours with a reported sense of complete evacuation.</p><p>Chronic constipation: Defecation reported as unsatisfactory with symptoms of infrequent stool and/or difficult stool passage lasting at least the previous 3 months.</p><p>Functional constipation: Also known as idiopathic constipation is type of chronic constipation with no physiological abnormalities present.</p><p>Rome IV Criteria for Functional Constipation<sup>1</sup>:</p><table cellspacing="0" class="MsoTableGrid" style="border-collapse:collapse; border:none">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td colspan="2" style="border-bottom:1px solid black; border-left:1px solid black; border-right:1px solid black; border-top:1px solid black; padding:0in 7px 0in 7px; vertical-align:top; width:681px">			<p>Must include 2 or more of the following fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months prior to diagnosis</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style="border-bottom:1px solid black; border-left:1px solid black; border-right:1px solid black; border-top:1px solid black; padding:0in 7px 0in 7px; vertical-align:top; width:30px">			<p>a.</p>			</td>			<td style="border-bottom:1px solid black; border-left:none; border-right:1px solid black; border-top:1px solid black; padding:0in 7px 0in 7px; vertical-align:top; width:651px">			<p>Straining during more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style="border-bottom:1px solid black; border-left:1px solid black; border-right:1px solid black; border-top:1px solid black; padding:0in 7px 0in 7px; vertical-align:top; width:30px">			<p>b.</p>			</td>			<td style="border-bottom:1px solid black; border-left:none; border-right:1px solid black; border-top:1px solid black; padding:0in 7px 0in 7px; vertical-align:top; width:651px">			<p>Lumpy or hard stools (Bristol stool from scale 1&ndash;2) during more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style="border-bottom:1px solid black; border-left:1px solid black; border-right:1px solid black; border-top:1px solid black; padding:0in 7px 0in 7px; vertical-align:top; width:30px">			<p>c.</p>			</td>			<td style="border-bottom:1px solid black; border-left:none; border-right:1px solid black; border-top:1px solid black; padding:0in 7px 0in 7px; vertical-align:top; width:651px">			<p>Sensation of incomplete evacuation during more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style="border-bottom:1px solid black; border-left:1px solid black; border-right:1px solid black; border-top:1px solid black; padding:0in 7px 0in 7px; vertical-align:top; width:30px">			<p>d.</p>			</td>			<td style="border-bottom:1px solid black; border-left:none; border-right:1px solid black; border-top:1px solid black; padding:0in 7px 0in 7px; vertical-align:top; width:651px">			<p>Sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage during more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td style="border-bottom:1px solid black; border-left:1px solid black; border-right:1px solid black; border-top:1px solid black; padding:0in 7px 0in 7px; vertical-align:top; width:30px">			<p>e.</p>			</td>			<td style="border-bottom:1px solid black; border-left:none; border-right:1px solid black; border-top:1px solid black; padding:0in 7px 0in 7px; vertical-align:top; width:651px">			<p>Manual maneuvers to facilitate more than one fourth (25%) of defecations (eg, digital evacuation, support of the pelvic floor)</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td colspan="2" style="border-bottom:1px solid black; border-left:1px solid black; border-right:1px solid black; border-top:1px solid black; padding:0in 7px 0in 7px; vertical-align:top; width:681px">			<p>Loose stools are rarely present without the use of laxatives</p>			</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td colspan="2" style="border-bottom:1px solid black; border-left:1px solid black; border-right:1px solid black; border-top:1px solid black; padding:0in 7px 0in 7px; vertical-align:top; width:681px">			<p>Insufficient criteria for irritable bowel syndrome</p>			</td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>To diagnose functional constipation, presence of 2 from the Rome IV criteria (number a,b) with duration between 3 to 6 months is needed.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Włodarczyk J, Waśniewska A, Fichna J, et al.
