The eXciteOSA<sup>&reg;</sup> (Signifier Medical Technologies, Needham, MA) is the first OSA treatment device to be used while awake and is intended to improve tongue function.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Position Statement</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p><strong>Investigational and Not Medically Necessary:</strong></p><p>The use of a neuromuscular electrical training device is considered <strong>investigational and not medically necessary</strong> for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea or snoring.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Rationale</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>In February 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized marketing of the eXciteOSA device, formerly known as the Snoozeal device, as a treatment of snoring and mild OSA. The authorization was approved based on the Baptista study (2021). The device was reviewed through the De Novo premarket review pathway. The FDA identified this device as:</p><p style="margin-left:40px">Neuromuscular tongue muscle stimulator for the reduction of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea. A neuromuscular tongue muscle stimulator for the reduction of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea consists of a removable intraoral mouthpiece that uses electrodes to deliver neuromuscular stimulation to the tongue to strengthen tongue musculature to reduce snoring and obstructive sleep apnea.</p><p>During sleep, there is a reduction in muscle tone and increased collapsibility in the throat and tongue. Neuromuscular electrical training is proposed to treat OSA based on the premise that transcutaneous electrical stimulation can improve tone and function in dysfunctional skeletal muscles (Baptista, 2021). Myofunctional therapy, isotonic and isometric exercises involving muscles of the mouth, pharynx and upper respiratory tract to improve the function of the upper airway dilator muscles, has been investigated as a non-invasive, non-pharmacological technique to treat OSA. Therapy is meant to increase tone, tension, endurance and mobility of the oropharyngeal muscles and soft tissues that collapse during apnea episodes (Rueda, 2020). In a systematic review of nine randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), Reuda (2020) found no objective evidence that myofunctional therapy improves OSA. Compared to CPAP therapy, myofunctional therapy showed little to no difference in daytime sleepiness and a possible increase in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). While the review did not include any studies which used neuromuscular electrical training devices, the results did not show that treatment focusing on toning and strengthening the oropharyngeal muscles improved clinical outcomes.</p><p>In an industry sponsored pilot study, Wessolleck and colleagues (2018) evaluated whether electrical stimulation of the intraoral musculature, using an intraoral stimulation training device (eXciteOSA), decreases snoring in those without OSA or with mild OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] &lt; 15). Snoring intensity before, during, and 2 weeks post-treatment was reported by bed partners who documented the intensity according to a visual analog scale (VAS). While 16 participants were initially included, only 13 participants completed the study. The participants&rsquo; bed partners reported a significantly reduced snoring intensity from baseline up to 2 weeks following treatment. While the participants underwent sleep testing prior to participation to check for the presence of OSA and the level of severity based on AHI, there was no further testing of AHI following treatment. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the treatment of clinically significant OSA based on this small, short-term case series which focused on subjectively-reported snoring intensity.</p><p>An industry sponsored, multicenter, prospective study by Baptista and colleagues (2021) evaluated the use of daytime neuromuscular electrical training (NMES) of tongue muscles to treat primary snoring with mild sleep apnea. Participants included those with documented snoring (n=125). A segment of this population also had a mild OSA diagnosis (n=48). Prior to inclusion in the study, individuals underwent a screening sleep test to confirm an AHI &lt; 15. In addition, participants needed to have a consistent daily bed partner to report snoring intensity using VAS. Participants used the device for 6 weeks, then discontinued use for 2 weeks before reassessment using a home sleep study. The partner began reporting 2 weeks prior the 6-week treatment phase and ended 2 weeks following the treatment phase. The change in the proportion of time snoring at levels &gt; 40dB, the primary endpoint, showed a mean reduction of 41% at the second sleep study. Approximately 90% of participants demonstrated some level of reduction in their objective snoring time. While the mean AHI was statistically significantly improved from 6.85 to 5.03, the improvement was not clinically meaningful. Subjective measures such as partner reported VAS, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were improved from baseline compared to the end of the study results. While this study incorporated objective outcome measurements, this small study was limited by no comparison group and short-term follow-up. Finally, the study was not adequately powered to detect a 20% reduction in snoring time with 80% power.</p><p>In another industry sponsored prospective cohort study, Kotecha and associates (2021) evaluated the usefulness of an intraoral neuromuscular stimulation device in treating individuals with primary snoring or mild OSA. Several features of both conditions were assessed, including: % of time snoring, different loudness levels, AHI, oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and oxygen saturations. Sleep studies were performed before and following the 6-week treatment period. A total of 75 participants were included and 70 completed the trial; 32 of those who completed the trial had a diagnosis of snoring and 38 had mild OSA. The group with a primary diagnosis of snoring reported an average 41% reduction in all snoring above 40dB. In participants with mild OSA, the AHI and ODI posttreatment levels were reduced compared to pretreatment levels: 9.8 compared to 4.7 events/hour (52% reduction) and 7.8 compared to 4.3 events/hour (45% reduction), respectively. As in earlier studies, the results are limited by its small size, lack of a control group and the short follow-up period.</p><p>The remaining evidence regarding the efficacy of neuromuscular electrical training devices is limited to a few additional small, short studies with unfavorable efficacy results, particularly in the treatment of OSA (Chwieśko-Minarowska, 2016; Randerath, 2004). No medical societies address the use of a neuromuscular electrical training device in the treatment of OSA.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Background/Overview</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>Both OSA and snoring are considered types of sleep disordered breathing disorders. OSA affects approximately 2 to 9% of individuals in the United States, with 60% categorized as mild OSA. Habitual snoring can indicate a susceptibility to and a precursor for OSA. The treatment of snoring and mild OSA is considered controversial (Baptista, 2021).</p><p>The eXciteOSA device is a removable neuromuscular stimulation device which delivers stimulation to the tongue. The use of the device once a day is intended to improve tongue muscle function and, over time, theorized to prevent the tongue from collapsing backwards and obstructing the airway during sleep. Once the mouthpiece is inserted into the mouth, 4 electrodes located above and below the tongue deliver consecutive electrical muscle stimulation sessions with rest periods in between. A smartphone application controls therapy intensity and monitors usage. The device is intended to be used once a day for 20 minutes for 6 weeks then decreasing to once a week after the initial active treatment phase. The device is not intended to be used in individuals with OSA and an AHI of 15 and higher.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Definitions</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>Apnea: A transient period where breathing ceases.</p><p>Apnea-Hypopnea index (AHI): A measure of apnea severity defined by the total number of episodes of apnea or hypopnea during a full period of sleep divided by the number of hours asleep.</p><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): This is a form of sleep disturbance, which occurs as the result of a physical occlusion of the upper airway during sleep, which interferes with normal breathing.

Instead, please fax the request to Anthem Blue Cross Grievance and Appeals at fax # 818-234-2767 or 818-234-3824. For questions, call G&amp;A at 1-800-365-0609 and ask to speak with the Investigational Review Nurse.</p><p>Federal and State law, as well as contract language, including definitions and specific contract provisions/exclusions, take precedence over Medical Policy and must be considered first in determining eligibility for coverage. The member&rsquo;s contract benefits in effect on the date that services are rendered must be used. Medical Policy, which addresses medical efficacy, should be considered before utilizing medical opinion in adjudication.
