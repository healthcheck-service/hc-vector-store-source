The ALCAT has been promoted as a diagnostic test for food allergy or intolerance (chemical sensitivity) and as a tool to establish elimination diets.</p><p>Mylek and colleagues (1995) explored the use of the ALCAT results as the base for elimination diet treatment in several conditions considered to be the result of food allergy (intolerance). A total of 72 participants (45 children and 27 adults), suffering from various symptoms of unproven etiologies and who had undergone a variety of treatments without improvement, were enrolled in the study. An ALCAT with 50 foods, skin prick test with 11 common inhalants and 28 foods and a detailed history were performed. Clinicians assessed whether the diet tailored on the basis of the ALCAT results achieved an improvement in symptoms after 1 month of an individual elimination diet. Emotional disturbances were assessed after the participants had been on the elimination diet for 4 months. The best results (83% improvement) were seen in symptoms related to arthritis. A 75% improvement was reported in urticaria, bronchitis and gastroenteritis. Less favorable results (32% improvement) were reported in childhood hyperactivity. The researchers concluded that &ldquo;using the ALCAT Test in the course of allergologic diagnosis helps to describe less common foods that may cause reactions similar to that of apple, beetroots, lettuce, leek, pears, millet, oat or rice, etc.&rdquo; Some of the limitations of the Mylek study include a lack of a definition of &ldquo;emotional disturbances&rdquo;, and the fact that detailed study methods and results were not published. The authors indicate that the study participants were assessed for symptom improvement after 1 month on the elimination diet and for improvement in emotional disturbances after 4 months on the elimination diet. However, the authors failed to report exactly what was evaluated during the clinical assessment, how the severity of symptoms were measured and failed to provide a breakdown of the results at the 1- and 4-month intervals.&nbsp;</p><p>Several review articles have addressed unproven tests for allergy diagnosis (Hammond, 2018; Wuthrick 2005) and have concluded that the ALCAT test results are not reproducible and do not correlate with clinical symptoms.</p><p>The evidence-based allergy testing guidelines on food allergy from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) (Sampson, 2014) do not mention ALCAT as one of the recognized tests for the evaluation of potential allergy.</p><p><em>Basophil Activation Test (BAT)</em></p><p>The 2008 AAAAI and ACAAI Practice Parameter on Allergy Diagnostic Testing stated: &ldquo;A basophil activation test measured by expression of CD63 and CD203c and detected by flow cytometry is being evaluated for many IgE-mediated disorders. (C)&rdquo; The Practice Parameter included a summary statement that, along with several other tests, &ldquo;basophil activation tests are additional diagnostic tests for drug allergy. Further studies are required to confirm their clinical utility in the evaluation of drug allergic patients. (B)&rdquo;</p><p>The guidelines published by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) recommended &ldquo;not using any of the following nonstandardized tests for the routine evaluation of IgE-mediated FA [food allergy]&rdquo;. The list of tests includes &ldquo;basophil histamine release/activation&rdquo;. The guidelines further stated, &ldquo;although the basophil histamine release/activation test is not a routine diagnostic test for IgE-mediated food allergies, it is commonly used in the research setting.&rdquo; (Boyce, 2010).</p><p>A review and position paper from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) (Hoffman, 2015) concluded:</p><p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:48px">Basophil activation test has been established as a routine diagnostic test with standardized allergen preparations in a number of service laboratories. The routine application of BAT for established allergens is quite different to that of identifying and characterizing novel allergens or monitoring allergy intensity. To strengthen the use of BAT as diagnostic test, laboratory procedures and allergen concentrations in BAT should be standardized... An important next step is the standardization and automation of analysis of BAT. Once that is achieved, it will be possible to do large multicenter trials to characterize the diagnostic performance of BAT and broaden its use as a clinical tool. These multicenter studies should also address the relationship of measures of BAT and sensitivity to sIgE, clinical symptoms, and symptom severity.</p><p><em>Cytotoxic Testing</em><br />Cytotoxic testing is known by a variety of names, including but not limited to, Bryan&#39;s Test, the leukocytotoxicity test, the leukocytic food allergy test, the cytotoxic leukocyte test and the CYTOTOXIC test. A review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that the cytotoxic test is &ldquo;An unproven diagnostic procedure unsupported by the scientific literature or well-controlled studies and clinical trials&rdquo; (FDA, 1985). The 2008 AAAAI and ACAAI Practice Parameter statement concluded cytotoxic testing is one of the tests &ldquo;for which there is no evidence of diagnostic validity&rdquo;. NIAID does not recommend nonstandardized tests (cytotoxic testing) for the routine evaluation of IgE-mediated food allergies (Boyce, 2010).</p><p><em>IgG-Mediated Food Sensitivity Testing </em><br />Measurement of IgG and specifically IgG4 antibodies is frequently carried out in the research settings as diagnostic and prognostic tests to determine response to allergy treatments. Specific IgG/IgG4 results do not correlate with oral food challenges and are not recommended for diagnosing food allergies. The guidelines published by the AAAAI state that &ldquo;measurement of food-specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies in serum are not recommended for the diagnosis of non&ndash;IgE-mediated food-related allergic disorders&rdquo; (Sampson, 2014).</p><p>A 2018 review article by Hammond and Lieberman identified several studies evaluating food-specific serum IgG, but none of the studies were well-designed trials and many of them lacked controls.</p><p>The EAACI notes that testing for blood IgG4 against different foods is being more frequently performed with large-scale screening for hundreds of food items by ELISA-type and radioallergosorbent-type tests. However, many serum samples show positive IgG4 results in the absence of corresponding clinical symptoms. These findings, in conjunction with the lack of convincing evidence for the histamine-releasing properties of IgG4 in humans, and lack of any controlled studies on the diagnostic value of IgG4 testing in food allergy, do not provide any basis for the hypothesis that food-specific IgG4 results in food hypersensitivity. To the contrary, elevated IgG4 levels may indicate that an individual has been repeatedly exposed to food components, recognized as foreign proteins by the immune system. Its presence should not be considered as a factor which causes hypersensitivity, but rather as an indicator for immunological tolerance, linked to the activity of regulatory T cells. Food-specific IgG4 does not indicate (imminent) food allergy or intolerance, but rather a physiological response of the immune system after exposure to food components. Therefore, &ldquo;Testing of IgG4 to foods is considered as irrelevant for the laboratory work-up of food allergy or intolerance and should not be performed in case of food-related complaints&rdquo; (Stapel, 2008).</p><p>IgG antibody testing for food intolerance is generally offered by CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) approved laboratories. The BloodPrint<sup>&trade;</sup> test (Immuno Laboratories, Fort Lauderdale, FL) is an example of a laboratory test that measures IgG response. There are several types of BloodPrint tests which vary by number. The numbers (154, 115, 88, 108 and 104) are indicative of how many different foods are being tested. Samples for the BloodPrint test can be drawn at a local laboratory or a physician&rsquo;s office and sent to Immuo Laboratories for processing at a CLIA certified facility. A search of the peer-reviewed, scientific literature did not reveal any published studies for the BloodPrint test.&nbsp;</p><p>The HEMOCODE<sup>&trade;</sup> Food Tolerance System (Gemoscan, Ontario, Canada) is marketed as more than an IgG test. In addition to the test, it includes a &ldquo;comprehensive program&rdquo;, supervised by Doctors of Naturopathic Medicine. The system includes a preliminary face-to-face consultation and follow-up review of the test results with a health professional. The HEMOCODE Food Tolerance System is not available online but can be purchased through participating retailers. A search of the peer-reviewed, scientific literature did not reveal any publications related to the HEMOCODE test.</p><p>The US BioTek Laboratories (Shoreline, WA) IgG antibody assays (IgA and IgG) measure all 4 subclasses (IgG1 through IgG4) and are reported as a total IgG value on a semi-quantitative scale for each antigen. Information on the US BioTek Laboratories web site indicates that the panel is not available online but can be requested via a healthcare practitioner. A search of the peer-reviewed, scientific literature did not reveal any publications related to the US BioTek Laboratories antibody assessment panel.</p><p>The Complement Antigen Test (Sage Medical Laboratories, Ormond Beach, FL) measures IgG and components of complement to identify delayed food allergies. However, a search of the peer-reviewed, scientific literature did not reveal any publications related to the Complement Antigen Test. The Complement Antigen Test should not be confused with a complement assay or complement testing which measures the activity of the complement system. Unlike the Complement Antigen Test which measures circulating immune complexes (antibody-complement) response to delayed food allergies, complement testing is routinely carried out to diagnose and monitor certain autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. &nbsp;</p><p><em>Leukocyte histamine release test</em><br />In the leukocyte histamine release test (LHRT), leukocytes from the serum of an allergic individual are observed for the release of histamine in the presence of an antigen.</p><p>There is a lack of well-designed controlled studies evaluating the diagnostic and clinical utility of the LHRT. The AAAAI and ACAAI guidelines for allergy diagnostic testing indicate that the LHRT is a valuable research tool for in vitro investigations of allergy (Bernstein, 2008).&nbsp;</p><p><em>Mediator Release Test</em><br />No published literature on the mediator release test (MRT<sup>&reg;</sup>), a patented test from Oxford Biomedical Technologies, was identified.</p><p>Allergy testing guidelines from the AAAAI and the NIAID do not mention the MRT as one of the recognized tests for the evaluation of potential allergy (Boyce 2010; Sampson, 2014).</p><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Background/Overview</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), food allergies should be suspected in the following: (1) individuals presenting with anaphylaxis or select symptoms that occur within minutes to hours of ingesting food, especially in young children and/or if symptoms have followed the ingestion of a specific food on more than one occasion; (2) infants, young children and selected older children diagnosed with conditions such as moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), enterocolitis, enteropathy, and allergic proctocolitis; and (3) adults diagnosed with EoE (Boyce, 2010).</p><p>The standard of care in the medical community for diagnosing food allergies includes a medical history, a physical examination and diagnostic tools, such as the percutaneous (scratch, prick, or puncture) tests, the allergen-specific serum IgE test, food elimination diets and oral food challenges (double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge).&nbsp;</p><p>Unproven blood, serum and cellular allergy and toxicity tests, addressed in this document, are described below.</p><p><em>ALCAT</em><br />ALCAT measures whole blood leukocyte activity to identify allergens which cause an increase in leukocyte activity. An electronic counter measures the change in number and size of leukocytes which have been incubated with purified food or mold extracts. A histogram is produced which reflects the cell count and cell size. The test samples are then compared with a &quot;Master Control&quot; graph. The ALCAT has been promoted as a diagnostic test for food allergy or intolerance (chemical sensitivities) in conditions such as, but not limited to arthritis, urticaria, bronchitis, gastroenteritis, childhood hyperreactivity, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Typically, the results are used to establish elimination diets for these diseases. The ALCAT is manufactured by Cell Science Systems, Corp. (CSS), located in Deerfield Beach, Florida, which has a CLIA certified lab.</p><p><em>Basophil Activation Test (BAT)</em><br />The BAT is proposed as a test to determine allergic response, including food allergies and also insect vemon allergies, drug allergies and chronic urticaria. The BAT assesses response of basophils in a sample of fresh blood to allergen cross-linking IgE, using the activation marker CD63 or another activation marker such as CD203c. The BAT can be performed in most research laboratories using a flow cytometer, which can measure the fraction of reactive or activated basophils in the sample. There is a time limitation on performing the test on a blood sample since basophils have a half-life of less than a week (Hoffman, 2015).</p><p><em>Cytotoxic testing </em><br />Cytotoxic testing for food allergies is purported to be useful for diagnosing food allergies and food intolerances. The premise of cytotoxic testing is based on the theory that mixing an individual&rsquo;s white blood cells with an antigen to which that individual is allergic, results in injury to the cells. This test involves the exposure of leukocytes to the presence of food extracts to which the individual is allergic. A technician then observes the unstained cells for changes in the size, shape, appearance or integrity. Swelling, vacuolation or other cytotoxic changes in cell morphology are taken as evidence of an allergic reaction to food.&nbsp;</p><p><em>IgG-Mediated Food Sensitivity Testing </em><br />IgG antibody testing for food intolerance is based on the premise that elevated levels of IgG antibodies are an indicator of food intolerances. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is frequently divided into four subclasses. Selective deficiencies in one or more of the four IgG groups may be seen in some individuals with repeated infections. IgG and IgG subclasses can be measured in a manner similar to those for allergen specific IgE. Controversy exists regarding whether increases of IgG4 are valid indicators of either diagnosis of a food allergy or clinical efficacy after immunotherapy.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Leukocyte histamine release test</em><br />The leukocyte histamine release test (LHRT, basophil histamine release test) measures the amount of histamine released in the presence of an antigen. Varying concentrations of an allergen extract are added to the peripheral blood leukocytes of the individual being tested. Histamine is normally released as a result of the interaction of allergen with cell-bound IgE antibodies. If the individual is allergic to a specific antigen, the leukocytes should release histamine in-vitro upon stimulation of said antigen, unless the individual has recently been exposed and his/her cells are in a refractory state. A limited number of allergens can be tested using a single aliquot of blood.</p><p><em>Mediator Release Test</em><br />The MRT is a patented test from Oxford Biomedical Technologies (formerly the Signet Diagnostic Corporation). According to the manufacturer, the MRT measures volumetric changes in lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes and eosinophils after food or food-chemical challenges. Test results are reported as &lsquo;non-reactive&rsquo;, &lsquo;moderately reactive&rsquo; or &lsquo;reactive&rsquo; and can be used to develop a food sensitivity eating plan marketed by clinics operated by Oxford Biomedical Technologies.</p><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Definitions</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>Allergen: Any substance that can cause an allergic reaction.</p><p>Allergy: An acquired potential for developing adverse reactions that are mediated by the immune system (via IgE antibodies).</p><p>Antibody: A type of protein produced by the immune system in response to substances called antigens.&nbsp;</p><p>Antigen: Any substance that, when introduced into the body, evokes an immune response and stimulates the production of antibodies.</p><p>Atopic dermatitis: A skin disease characterized by areas of severe itching, redness, and scaling.</p><p>Basophil: A type of white blood cell known as a granulocyte.
