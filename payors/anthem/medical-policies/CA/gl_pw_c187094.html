II-HBHS are a range of therapy services provided face-to-face in the home to address symptoms and behaviors that, as the result of a psychiatric disorder or substance use disorder, put the members and others at risk of harm. &ldquo;Home&rdquo; describes a family living arrangement that reflects a sustained (months to lifetime) commitment to the member, that is, a commitment based on parenthood, marriage, kinship, adoption, guardianship, or other close personal relationship. The provided service includes member and family interventions intended to help the member and family, especially responsible adults, to address the symptoms and behaviors related to a psychiatric disorder or substance use disorder in a caring fashion that reduces the risk of harm with the goal of returning the member to a status where services can be continued in a setting outside the home. Intensity or hours of II-HBHS is tied to the risk of harm through a treatment plan and goals that specify how hours of service, greater than those typical of office or clinic care, (which is usually no more than an hour per visit and often less than every week), are needed to reduce risk and improve health. A description of the critical relationship between the home environment and the symptoms and behaviors that create risk is a necessary component of the treatment plan. Treatment in the home that addresses individual and family issues related to the setting separates II-HBHS from facility-based services, such as Partial Hospital Programs (PHP) and Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP). Achieving harm reduction and improved health are anticipated to result in use of office-based services.</p><p>The medical necessity criteria outlined in this document relating to psychiatric disorders or mood/behavior disturbance treatment includes two categories; Severity of Illness and Continued Stay. Severity of Illness criteria include descriptions of the member&rsquo;s condition and circumstances. For continued authorization of the requested service, Continued Stay criteria must be met, along with Severity of Illness criteria.</p><p>The member&rsquo;s symptoms or condition should meet diagnostic criteria for a behavioral health condition, as defined in the most recent edition of the American Psychiatric Association&#39;s (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The diagnosis should be consistent with symptoms and the primary focus of treatment.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Benefits, state mandates and regulatory requirements should be verified prior to application of criteria listed below.

Unlike medical Home Health Services for treatments, such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, etc., individuals receiving II-HBHS are <em>not </em>necessarily confined to home, (that is, homebound). These services or treatments are provided in the home because it is the best setting for addressing ongoing behavioral impairments related to individual, family or social interactions that put the member and others at risk. In-home treatment is oriented to the specific dysfunctional behaviors that are adversely affecting the individual&rsquo;s ability to function or to perform activities of daily living (ADL) in the member&rsquo;s environment. The services should have a positive effect on those close to the member, for the purpose of improving the home environment. II-HBHS is a combination of individual, group and family therapy.</p><p>Psychiatric disorders that impact the individual&rsquo;s ability to function or to perform ADL can include a wide range of behavioral health diagnoses. The illnesses are described in current diagnostic sources, which primarily include the American Psychiatric Association&#39;s (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Classification of Diseases (DSM, ICD). The type of service needed reflects the gravity and acuity of symptoms. The initial course of II-HBHS requires determination of the appropriate intensity of care (number of visits per week and hours per visit) and duration of care (usually 1 to 6 months for initial services), in order to help ensure the potential safety of the member and any minor dependents. Safety concerns of other family members, people close to the individual and society at large should also receive attention. The criteria in this document are intended to address those at-risk individuals who, due to either psychiatric disorders or disturbances of mood or behavior, are considered to be in need of focused, ongoing, in-home services to assist with targeted behavioral impairments in performing ADL or other targeted functional activities. There should be a reasonable expectation that the member&rsquo;s symptoms or level of functioning will be stabilized or improved within a reasonable period of II-HBHS known to be effective for the individual&rsquo;s symptoms or mood/behavioral disturbance.&nbsp;</p><p>II-HBHS should include focused individualized coordination of care utilizing a detailed treatment plan which is determined by an appropriately trained and licensed medical professional, acting within their scope of practice, in collaboration with the member and close family members and significant others. Continued services require reassessment by the medical professional at set time intervals, in order to determine if the individual is demonstrating behavioral improvement and willingness to participate in the treatment plan. The core clinical staff members involved in the delivery of II-HBHS may include: psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counselors (including addiction counselors when appropriate), medical and nursing personnel. Occupational, recreational and creative arts therapists may also provide services. Paraprofessionals, that is, non-degreed individuals, students and interns under the supervision of appropriate professionals, may also be included.</p><p>II-HBHS are usually provided at least 2-3 times per week for 1-2 hours per visit for the initial intensity of care, which varies depending on individual severity of symptoms and circumstances, but usually extends for an initial duration of care of at least 4 weeks before reassessment is conducted. With symptom improvement, a gradual decrease in services per week may occur to help plan for successful discharge and greater independent functioning. Examples of active, age-appropriate treatment may include: individual psychotherapy, family therapy, psycho-educational (theme-specific) groups, skills training, expressive/activity therapies, medication evaluation/management, and group therapy. For children and adolescents, family therapy, (including significant others), should be provided at least one time each week. Group therapy should be individualized to meet the member&rsquo;s needs, based on specific clinical needs or functional level. &nbsp;</p><p>Throughout provision of II-HBHS a detailed clinical record should be maintained. The record should contain an initial assessment, physician orders and certification of need for this level of care, psychiatric assessment, and an individualized, age-appropriate treatment plan with goals that address the individual&rsquo;s needs. Goals should be achievable within the timeframe of the program. Member and family signatures, especially the signature of a responsible adult, should be part of the treatment plan. The record should contain information about medication management, progress notes and, at completion, a discharge summary to be shared with all involved providers, especially those who will be providing any ongoing care, as warranted.&nbsp;</p><p>Individualized goals should target resolution of specific symptoms or stabilization of mood and/or behavior consistent with the DSM/ICD diagnosis. Goals should also target specific domains of functional impairment. Goals should be achievable within the timeframe of the program. If a substance use disorder is known to be present or thought to be present, a substance use evaluation should have also been performed and treatment provided with the cooperation of the member. Community/natural supports and resources should be identified and utilized or skills to develop community/natural supports should be a treatment goal, including school/work interventions, self-help or diagnosis-specific support groups, spiritual/religious, and community recreational activities. Family member(s) and significant other&rsquo;s participation in treatment or family therapy should also be documented. Treatment should not be duplicative of services being provided by another clinician for the same functional impairments/diagnoses. There should be adherence to documentation and treatment plan guidelines.</p><p>In 2014, Love and colleagues published observations based on archival data from a convenience sample of youth clients in a child mental health system. The purpose of this observational data collection was to examine the frequency of therapist-identified treatment targets and progress ratings for these targets during the first six months of II-HBHS. The study sample consisted of 790 youths aged 7&ndash;18 (M=14.08; standard deviation [SD]=2.87) receiving II-HBHS from a comprehensive, state-funded, mental health system for a minimum of 90 days (to ensure sufficient exposure to therapy). The mean treatment episode length was 229 days (SD=132.5), with a range of 788 days (90 minimum, 878 maximum; 25th quartile=136, 50th quartile=188, 75th quartile=282). All study questions were addressed using data from the first 180 days (6 months) of treatment, in order to allow sufficient time for treatment response to emerge while reducing the likelihood that episode length would be a confounding variable in the results. The mean number of records for this period was 5.14 (SD=1.47), which indicated that, on average, youth treatment data were available for at least 5 of the 6 months encompassed by the study window. The Monthly Treatment and Progress Summary (MTPS) was used for each subject, which is a therapist-report measure that tracks service utilization information, including service format and setting, treatment targets, therapist intervention strategies, and clinical progress ratings on identified targets. The MTPS also includes a list of 48 predetermined treatment targets from which the therapist checks off up to 10 targets that were the focus of treatment during the reporting month. On average across the sample, 47.9% of the targets chosen at least once during a youth&rsquo;s treatment episode aligned with one of the four most common DSM categories of childhood disorders. The most frequently endorsed diagnosis-aligned targets were oppositional/non-compliant behavior (71.5%), activity involvement (66.2%), anger (64.3%), and aggression (47.9%), which is consistent with the high prevalence of disruptive behavior and depressive mood disorders present in this age group sample. The mean level of improvement across all targets was 3.10 (SD=0.42) on the 0-to-6 scale, which aligns with the fourth MTPS rating anchor which was &ldquo;Some improvement&rdquo; (31&ndash;50%). &nbsp;</p><p>Among targets appearing in at least 5% of the sample, &ldquo;Treatment Engagement&rdquo; demonstrated the highest level of improvement (M=3.75; SD=1.54), while &ldquo;Learning Disorder&rdquo; demonstrated the lowest (M=2.63; SD=1.36). Several of the most commonly endorsed targets were among those demonstrating the higher levels of improvement, including &ldquo;Activity Involvement&rdquo; (M=3.64; SD=1.50), &ldquo;Positive Peer Interaction&rdquo; (M=3.62; SD=1.32), and &ldquo;Aggression&rdquo; (M=3.61; SD=1.40). Among targets showing the least improvement, several were associated with neurobiological impairments, including &ldquo;Learning Disorder, Mania (M=2.36; SD=1.74) and Psychosis (M=2.44; SD=2.06).&rdquo; The mean rate to highest improvement was 81 days (SD=17.4), which were considered significant and positively correlated (r=0.66; p&lt;0.001), indicating a trend towards higher levels of improvement taking longer to be achieved. The authors concluded that, while the results were promising, limitations and confounding factors, (such as differing subject age at entry and types of comorbidity, differing therapist training and experience, and differing types and ordering of interventional strategies) remain to be investigated further regarding the best use of treatment targets in delivering II-HBHS (Love, 2014). These reports give a clear picture of troublesome symptoms and behaviors thought to merit II-HBHS and support the inclusion of family and significant others.</p><p>To date, published research suggesting beneficial outcomes specific to II-HBHS is limited but encouraging. In 2003, Timko and colleagues published results of a comparative study of standard vs. intensive outpatient care for substance abuse and psychiatric treatment which provided the following conclusions:</p><p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:46px">Intensive outpatient mental health programs are proliferating rapidly. However, findings suggest that intensive treatment may be no more effective than standard treatment. This study compared standard to intensive outpatient programs, within both the psychiatric and substance abuse systems of care, on organization, staffing, and treatment orientation, clinical management practices, and services. A total of 723 (95% of those eligible) Department of Veterans Affairs programs were surveyed nationwide. Psychiatric intensive programs have responded appropriately to their more severely ill patients, in terms of the amount and orientation of care and having a rehabilitation focus. However, the relative lack of basic psychiatric services in psychiatric intensive programs and the overall similarity of substance abuse standards and intensive programs may explain why intensive programs have not yielded patient outcomes that are superior to those of standard programs. Mental health system planners should consider differentiating intensive programs using broader criteria and methods.</p><p>Some research has been published regarding the impact of II-HBHS on outcomes for perinatal women and their young children, particularly for at-risk individuals in lower socio-economic groups with depressive mood disorders occurring during the pregnancy or demonstrating symptoms during the post-partum period (up to 6 months following delivery). The available evidence has shown some significant improvements in the mothers&rsquo; depressive mood and social functioning at 6 months post-partum with in-home interventions. However, additional research is needed to further elucidate the potential for positive outcomes in parenting skills and child adjustments (Ammerman, 2013, 2015; Tandon, 2014). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to medical literature, federal and state sources provide information about II-HBHS. This guideline incorporates this information and is largely based on federal and state regulations regarding II-HBHS which include:</p><ul>	<li>Intensive, home-based services designed to address specific mental or nervous conditions in a child;</li>	<li>Evidence-based family-focused therapy that specializes in the treatment of juvenile substance use disorders;</li>	<li>Short-term family therapy intervention;</li>	<li>Intensive, family-based and community-based treatment programs that focus on addressing environmental systems that impact chronic and violent juvenile offenders;</li>	<li>Other home-based therapeutic interventions for children;</li>	<li>Psychological and neuropsychological testing conducted by an appropriately licensed health care provider;</li>	<li>Evidence-based maternal, infant and early childhood home visitation services, as described in Section 2951 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act P. L. 111-148, as amended from time to time, that are designed to improve health outcomes for pregnant women, postpartum mothers and newborns and children, including, but not limited to, maternal substance use disorders or depression and relationship-focused interventions for children with mental or nervous conditions or substance use disorders;</li>	<li>Chemical maintenance treatment, as defined in Section 19a-495-570 of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies; and</li>	<li>Extended day treatment programs.</li></ul><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Definitions</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>Intensive In-home Services (IIH): According to the state of Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS), IIH services for children/adolescents under age 21 are intensive, time-limited interventions provided typically, but not solely, in the residence of a child who is at risk of being moved into an out-of-home placement or who is being transitioned to home from out-of-home placement, due to the documented clinical needs of the child (Virginia DMAS, H-2012; 2013).</p><p>Serious Emotional Disturbance: A person under the age of 21 years who is all of the following:</p><ul>	<li>Diagnosed as having a mental, emotional, or behavioral disorder that meets one of the diagnostic categories specified in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association; and</li>	<li>Exhibits behaviors that substantially interfere with or limit the role or ability to function in the family, school, or community, which behaviors are not considered a temporary response to a stressful situation. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>Severe Mental Illness (also known as serious and persistent mental illness): A mental, behavioral or emotional disorder according to the most recent edition of the DSM, in members 18 years and older, that results in functional impairment which substantially interferes with, or limits, one or more major life activities (for example, maintaining interpersonal relationships, ADL, self-care, employment, recreation) that have occurred within the last year. All of these disorders may have acute episodes, as part of the chronic course of the disorder. An organization may also use its state definition or the definition of another appropriate regulatory authority (SAMHSA, 2022).</p><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>References</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p><strong>Peer Reviewed Publications:</strong></p><ol>	<li>Ammerman RT, Altaye M, Putnam FW, et al.
