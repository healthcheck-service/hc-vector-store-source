Treatments for dysfunctional hemodialysis access include surgical thrombectomy and revision, and angiographic evaluation. Angiographic evaluation, also known as endovascular management, is the preferred initial treatment for dysfunctional hemodialysis access and yields better clinical outcomes compared to surgical treatment (ACR-SIR, 2017). It can be performed as angiography alone or with stent placement. An individual should be referred for angiographic evaluation when there are persistent abnormalities of surveillance (for example, flow measurements and static pressures), and clinical monitoring (for example, in AVGs: an absent thrill, discontinuous bruit, or edema in the extremity distal to the graft, problems noted during the dialysis session, such as difficulty with cannulation, aspiration of clots, inability to achieve the target dialysis blood flow, or prolonged bleeding from the needle puncture sites, or an unexplained decrease in the delivered dialysis dose [Kt/V] on a constant hemodialysis prescription; and in AVFs: persistent arm swelling, collateral veins, and altered features of the pulse or thrill, problems noted during the dialysis session, such as prolonged bleeding after needle withdrawal, or unexplained persistent decrease in Kt/V [for example, &gt; 0.2 units]).</p><p>In 2007, Bakken and colleagues published a retrospective review of a database of consecutive hemodialysis individuals who underwent endovascular treatment for central venous stenosis. Primary angioplasty (PTA) (n=47) and primary stenting (PTS) (n=26) outcomes were assessed. The evaluators found that the initial endovascular treatment for stenosis had a technical success of 82% in the PTA group and 96% in the PTS group (p=0.08); however, residual stenosis occurred significantly more in the PTA group (53%) than the PTS group (7%; p&lt;0.001). The data also showed that &ldquo;primary patency was equivalent between groups by Kaplan-Meier analysis, with 30-day rates of 76% for both groups and 12-month rates of 29% for PTA and 21% for PTS (p=0.48)&rdquo; (Bakken, 2007). While endovascular therapy with PTA or PTS for central venous stenosis in hemodialysis individuals is safe with low rates of technical failure, long-term clinical utility is poor.</p><p>Nael and colleagues reported on a retrospective review in 2009 that evaluated long-term outcomes of endovascular treatment of hemodialysis individuals with threatened upper extremity dialysis access (n=600). Out of the initial 600 individuals evaluated, 69 individuals (11%) were identified as having central veno-occlusive disease. In the 92 venous segments with stenosis, transverse angioplasty was performed in 88 segments and stenting was performed in 6 segments. The data showed an initial technical success rate of 90%, and primary patency rates of hemodialysis access of 81%, 46%, and 22% at 1, 6, and 12 months, respectively. This review showed endovascular treatment of hemodialysis individuals with central veno-occlusive disease was safe and had low technical failure, but long-term success was low. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed for further evaluation.</p><p>In a prospective, multicenter trial, Haskal and colleagues (2010) assessed stenting versus balloon angioplasty as endovascular treatment of venous anastomotic stenosis in failing hemodialysis grafts. Individuals were randomly assigned to either undergo balloon angioplasty alone (n=93) or balloon angioplasty plus placement of stent graft (SG) (n=97). At 6 months post-treatment, the authors found that &ldquo;the incidence of patency of the treatment area was significantly greater in the SG group than in the balloon-angioplasty group (51% vs. 23%, p&lt;0.001), as was the incidence of patency of the access circuit (38% vs. 20%, p=0.008)&rdquo; (Haskal, 2010). It was also noted that the need for repeat interventions at 6 months was significantly less in the SG group compared with the balloon angioplasty group (32% vs. 16%, p=0.03). While this study showed better outcomes for clinical utility in stenting versus balloon angioplasty alone, the 6-month follow-up period was short and needs to be validated by studies with longer follow-up periods.</p><p>In 2015, Fu and colleagues released a meta-analysis that compared primary patency rates of stent placement versus angioplasty for dialysis vascular access stenosis. The literature search yielded 10 studies with a total of 860 individuals that met inclusion criteria, which were a measure of primary patency, secondary patency, or access dysfunction. There were four randomized studies, two nonrandomized studies, and four observational studies. The analysis of the studies showed significantly higher primary patency in individuals treated with stents than those treated with angioplasty (pooled relative risk [RR]=0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65-0.96). However, the results of this analysis are limited due to significant heterogeneity caused by varying types of access (AVF, AVG), lesions sites, and types of stents used in the included studies.</p><p>Also in 2015, Nassar and colleagues published an observational study that evaluated 520 cases (465 individuals) of thrombosed AVF treated by endovascular intervention. The study was comprised of two cohorts: retrospective cases (n=404) and prospectively studied cases (n=116). Thrombectomy clinical success was found in 91.9% of cases, and primary patency was 80.7%, 60.1%, 40.1%, 17.7%, and 0.06% at 30, 90, 180, 360, and 720 days, respectively. In addition, the authors found that &ldquo;the lower arm AVFs had both a primary patency and an assisted primary patency that were significantly better than the upper arm cases (p=0.006 and 0.002, respectively)&rdquo; (Nassar, 2015). A limitation to this study was combining retrospective and prospective data for overall study results.</p><p>Haskal and colleagues (2016) reported on a prospective, randomized controlled trial that compared stent grafts (SG) and PTA for the treatment of AVG anastomotic stenosis of &ge; 50%. The 28-site study enrolled 270 individuals with 191 (71%) completing it (lost to follow-up: PTA=1, SG=1; withdrew consent: PTA=1, SG=1; death: PTA=36, SG=38). Individuals were randomized into either the SG group (n=97) or the PTA group (n=94). Primary outcomes were access circuit primary patency (ACPP), index of patency function (IPF), and adverse events of the SG group compared with the PTA group. The evaluators found procedural success to be 81.2% in the SG group compared to 75% for the PTA group. Long-term outcomes at 24 months post-procedure showed significant findings: ACPP was SG 9.5% versus PTA 5.5% (p=0.01), and IPF was SG 7.1 months/intervention &plusmn; 7.0 versus PTA 5.3 months/intervention &plusmn; 5.2. The data showed no significant differences in adverse events (p&gt;0.05). The PTA group required reintervention due to restenosis for 82.6% of individuals versus 63% of individuals in the SG group (p&lt;0.001). Additional large systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been performed that compared SG with plain balloon PTA. Success rates and patency outcomes have reflected superior more durable outcomes from use of SG than PTA alone (Karnabatidis, 2013; Kouvelos, 2018; Marmagkiolis, 2019).</p><p>The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Vascular Access was updated in 2019 with a detailed review of the published evidence and a refocused approach based on an individualized P-L-A-N for each person, called the Patient Life-Plan first, followed by his or her corresponding access needs. Critical review of new more rigorous evidence has resulted in a de-emphasis on the need for AV access surveillance but a greater emphasis on the need for improved practitioner training and application of vascular access monitoring. The following is excerpted:</p><p style="margin-left:48px; margin-right:46px">In clinical practice, many centers use surveillance techniques with the intention to detect early dysfunction in AVF and AVG with the premise that early identification and correction of stenosis may prevent clinically significant dysfunction, such as a thrombotic event. However, in clinical practice, it is difficult to predict which stenosis (anatomic abnormality) will progress into a clinically significant functional abnormality, such as an occlusive thrombosis. Intervening on stenosis that are clinically asymptomatic may lead to unnecessary interventions, and, subsequently, more interventions to maintain patency, which does not appear to be improved with pre-emptive intervention. Thus, given the evidence available from the literature, our recommendations are to intervene only on AVFs and AVGs that have clinically relevant dysfunction when detected on routine clinical monitoring (e.g. abnormal physical examination findings, low Kt/V without other cause, persistently inadequate blood flow rates to provide prescribed dialysis without other cause than the AV access, high venous pressure during dialysis, etc.). We do not recommend interventions in AVG and AVFs that do not have clinically significant dysfunction.</p><p style="margin-right:46px">The updated NKF guideline provides the following recommendations:</p><p style="margin-left:48px; margin-right:46px">Endovascular Intervention to Improve Patency:</p><ul style="margin-left:40px">	<li>KDOQI does not recommend pre-emptive angioplasty of AVFs with stenosis, not associated with clinical indicators, to improve access patency.

For the purposes of dialysis access, this team should include, but is not limited to, the following professionals and supportive members: nephrologist, surgeon, radiologist, nurse, patient family member, or other supporter. The ESKD Life-Plan is a strategy that should start in the predialysis period and encompasses a continuum-of-care model for CKD to ESKD. This chain of careful, continual consideration of modalities and dialysis access lifelines as it pertains to the individual patient&rsquo;s circumstances, needs, and preferences is the essence of the ESKD Life-Plan (Lok, 2020).</p><p>In 2017, the American College of Radiology and the Society of Interventional Radiology issued a practice parameter for endovascular management of the thrombosed or dysfunctional dialysis access.

The percent stenosis reported can vary considerably depending on the reference chosen, that is, the smaller graft or vein upstream to the lesion (relative to direction of blood flow) versus a larger vein downstream (relative to direction of blood flow). Percent stenosis may also be affected by the presence or absence of blood flow in the access at the time of measurement.</li>	<li>Stenosis associated with thrombosis.

We reserve the right to review and update Clinical UM Guidelines periodically. Clinical guidelines approved by the Medical Policy &amp; Technology Assessment Committee are available for general adoption by plans or lines of business for consistent review of the medical necessity of services related to the clinical guideline when the plan performs utilization review for the subject. Due to variances in utilization patterns, each plan may choose whether to adopt a particular Clinical UM Guideline. To determine if review is required for this Clinical UM Guideline, please contact the customer service number on the member&#39;s card.</p><p>Alternatively, commercial or FEP plans or lines of business which determine there is not a need to adopt the guideline to review services generally across all providers delivering services to Plan&rsquo;s or line of business&rsquo;s members may instead use the clinical guideline for provider education and/or to review the medical necessity of services for any provider who has been notified that his/her/its claims will be reviewed for medical necessity due to billing practices or claims that are not consistent with other providers, in terms of frequency or in some other manner.</p><p>No part of this publication may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted, in any form or by any means, electronic, mechanical, photocopying, or otherwise, without permission from the health plan.</p><p>&copy; CPT Only - American Medical Association</p><noscript><img src="https://www.anthem.com/akam/13/pixel_705d9972?a=dD02ZDg4OGQ2YzM5NmU3NGQxMjQzMmRjOTNjOGJlMzhmZWQxZmI0Zjc0JmpzPW9mZg==" style="visibility: hidden; position: absolute; left: -999px; top: -999px;" /></noscript><script type="text/javascript"  src="/iOP-/eY9D/A/kZ/IVzY-qg/OuYDVXwhtJ/aioOJQUXBw/JwpDFiM/2Xh4"></script></body>			</html>
