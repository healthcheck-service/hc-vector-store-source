Ambulance transport may involve the movement of an individual to the nearest hospital for treatment of the individual&rsquo;s illness or injury, non-emergency medical transport of an individual to obtain medically necessary care not available in the individual&rsquo;s current location, &nbsp;or non-emergency medical transport to a health care facility or to an individual&rsquo;s home.</p><p class="MsoHeader">Although wheelchair vans are specially equipped to accommodate physically challenged individuals, they do not have the proper equipment to qualify as an ambulance. Proper equipment may include ventilation and airway management equipment, cardiac equipment (monitoring and defibrillation), immobilization devices, bandages, communication equipment, obstetrical kits, infection control, injury prevention equipment, vascular access equipment, and medications.</p><p class="MsoHeader">An ambulance may be a ground transportation vehicle, such as a specially equipped truck or van, but may also be a properly equipped helicopter or airplane, or it may be a specially equipped water craft. This document specifically addresses only air and water transportation-type ambulances.</p><p class="MsoHeader">In general, an emergency medical condition is defined as a medical condition characterized &nbsp;by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a prudent layperson possessing an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in:</p><ul>	<li class="MsoHeader">Placing the physical or mental health of the individual afflicted with such condition or, with respect to a pregnant person, the health of the individual or the unborn child, in serious jeopardy; or</li>	<li class="MsoHeader">Serious impairment to such individual&#39;s bodily functions; or</li>	<li class="MsoHeader">Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part of such individual.</li></ul><p class="MsoHeader">Examples of medical emergencies may include illness or injury such as chest pains that might indicate an acute coronary syndrome, slurred speech or weakness that might indicate a stroke, fracture, hemorrhaging, poisoning, major burns, loss of consciousness or respiratory accidents, convulsions, shock and other acute conditions.</p><p class="MsoHeader">The Medicare Benefit Policy Manual (2018) section addressing time needed for ground transportation (10.4.3) states the following:</p><p class="MsoHeader" style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:46px">Differing Statewide Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems determine the amount and level of basic and advanced life support ground transportation available. However, there are very limited emergency cases where ground transportation is available but the time required to transport the patient by ground as opposed to air endangers the beneficiary&rsquo;s life or health. As a general guideline, when it would take a ground ambulance 30-60 minutes or more to transport a beneficiary whose medical condition at the time of pick-up required immediate and rapid transport due to the nature and/or severity of the beneficiary&rsquo;s illness/injury, A/B MACs (A) and (B) should consider air transportation to be appropriate.</p><p class="MsoHeader">Time can be a key consideration to distinguish the need for ground transportation from the need for air transportation. Air transportation may be considered medically necessary if the total time between identification of the need for medical transportation and arrival at the treatment facility would be 30 or more minutes longer for ground transportation than for air transportation.<br />In mathematical terms:</p><p class="MsoHeader" style="margin-left:40px">If &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X = total time (in minutes) for transfer by ground<br />And&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y = total time (in minutes) for transfer by air<br />Then if X &gt; (Y + 30), air transportation may be considered necessary.</p><p class="MsoHeader">An important time consideration is the fact that it may take a significant amount of time to assemble an air transport team and to transport the individual from an emergency department to an airport or heliport to begin travel to the destination.</p><p class="MsoHeader">A 2020 retrospective study by Stewart and colleagues compared the outcomes of transport between helicopter transport and ground transport for inter-facility transfer of persons with trauma to tertiary trauma centers. Looking at the records of 9880 people who had been initially seen at a non-tertiary trauma center, but were then transferred to a tertiary trauma center, the authors reported on mortality at 72 hours and within the first 2 weeks after arriving at the tertiary trauma center. For those transferred by helicopter, the mean distance between the facilities was 96.7 miles with a mean distance of 69.9 miles for those transferred by ground ambulance. The helicopter transport group showed a decreased 72-hour mortality only for the individuals transferred less than 90 miles. There were no significant differences in mortality for helicopter transport greater than 90 miles, and no significant differences in mortality at 2 weeks for either transport modality.</p><p class="MsoHeader">In 2021, Kunte and colleagues reported on whether air or ground transport led to faster delivery times in interhospital transfer and direct-from-scene transfer of individuals with ischemic stroke to a comprehensive stroke center. In this retrospective review, there were four cohorts: transfer air (n=47), transfer ground (n=68), scene air (n=40) and scene ground (n=50). Three time periods were looked at within the transport process: alarm to emergency medical services (EMS) arrival, EMS arrival to EMS departure, and EMS departure to comprehensive stroke center arrival. Median alarm to EMS arrival time was 27.5 minutes for transfer air, 15.5 minutes for transfer ground, 22 minutes for scene air, and 10 minutes for scene ground. Total on scene time was represented by EMS arrival to EMS departure. Median EMS arrival to EMS departure time was 13 minutes for transfer air, 14 minutes for transfer ground, 7.5 minutes for scene air, and 12 minutes for scene ground. In order to evaluate EMS transfer time not associated with actual travel time, the authors measured the amount of time it took EMS to respond to alarms and prepare the individual for transfer. Those in the transfer cohort had a median alarm to EMS departure of 39 minutes versus 31 minutes for those in the scene cohort. Also in the transfer cohort, transfer air had a median alarm to EMS departure of 44 minutes versus 36 minutes for transfer ground. For those being transported from the scene, scene air median alarm to EMS departure time was 37.5 minutes compared to 25 minutes for scene ground noting air transport had longer EMS time before departure compared to ground transport. Modified Rankin score was used at 90 days after treatment to quantify functional outcomes. There were no significant differences in scores between the groups. The authors did not report whether outcomes were improved. In transporting individuals either between facilities or from scenes, some variables cannot be accounted for such as weather and traffic at the time of transfer.</p><p class="MsoHeader">A 2022 retrospective study by Joseph and colleagues reported outcomes of critically ill children who were transferred from one facility to a specialized pediatric hospital. The outcomes were compared for those who traveled via helicopter to those who traveled via ground ambulance. In order to limit indication bias, the analysis was limited to only those for whom a helicopter was initially requested by the receiving facility. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, mode of transport, and transport times. The cohort included 1186 children, 1044 who ultimately traveled by helicopter and 142 who ultimately traveled by ground ambulance (not related to clinical factors). The mean total travel time for helicopter transport was 143 minutes and the ground ambulance time was 289 minutes. In-hospital mortality was 63 individuals (6.0%) for those transferred by helicopter and 10 individuals (7.%) for those transferred by ground ambulance. Hospital length of stay was 4 days for those transferred by helicopter and 5 days for those who traveled by ground ambulance. In this retrospective cohort study the travel times were shorter for those who traveled via helicopter compared to ground ambulance, but the shorter travel times were not associated with statistically significant differences in mortality or hospital length of stay.</p><p class="MsoHeader">Elkbuli and colleagues (2022) also reported on a retrospective cohort study in which they analyzed outcomes for children and adults transported by helicopter compared to those transported by ground ambulance. The primary outcome was the raw and adjusted mortality adjusted for potential demographic and comorbid variables. These variables included age, race, ethnicity, comorbid conditions, mechanism of injury (only blunt and penetrating injuries were included), injury severity score, Glasgow coma score, revised trauma score and transport time. There were 12,633 individuals transferred during the study period (10,656 [84.4%] via ground ambulance and 1977 [15.6%] via helicopter). In the ground ambulance cohort there were 307 (2.88%) deaths, the mean injury severity score was 9.29, and the mean revised trauma score was 7.6. There were 9969 participants (93.6%) with blunt trauma. Mean total transport time from the field to the trauma center was 39.45 minutes. Intensive care unit stay was 2.30 days and the mean Glasgow coma score was 14.30. In the helicopter transport there were 134 (6.78%) deaths, the mean injury severity score was 11.73, and the mean revised trauma score was 7.12. There were 1560 participants (78.9%) with blunt injury. The mean total transport time from the field to the trauma center was 47.29 minutes. Intensive care unit stay was 4.19 days and the mean Glasgow coma score was 13.24. After controlling for defined covariates, the odds of mortality were 16.4% greater for those transported by ground ambulance compared to those transported by helicopter (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.164, 95% confidence interval [CI]: .814-1.665). After adjusting for transit time in addition to the defined covariates, the individuals transported by ground ambulance had a 16.6% greater odds of mortality compared to the individuals transported by helicopter (aOR =1.166, 95% CI: .815-1.668). The data in this study was from one single trauma center. Factors such as topography and weather at the time of transport may have affected the choice of transportation mode. The authors acknowledge that they could not control for differences in prehospital care.</p><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>References</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p><strong>Peer Reviewed Publications:</strong></p><ol>	<li>Elkbuli A, Dowd B, Sanchez C, et al.
