Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common and one of the most severe forms of inherited muscular dystrophies, is caused by a mutation of the DMD gene. The DMD gene is responsible for regulating the production of the dystrophin protein that helps keep muscles cells intact. In DMD, the lack of dystrophin weakens the link between the cytoskeleton and sarcolemma which then causes damage to the muscle fibers during contraction and leads to a cycle of muscle cell degeneration, inflammation, fibrosis, and inhibition of muscle fiber regeneration. This process results in progressive deterioration of muscle quality, mass and resulting weakness of facial, limb, respiratory, and cardiac muscles (Darras, 2022; Deng, 2022).</p><p>DMD is a rare, X-linked condition, occurring in approximatley1 in 5000 males born worldwide. The DMD gene is located on the X chromosome, and most cases are caused by carriers (mothers) passing the mutation to sons. The remaining one-third of DMD cases are the result of spontaneous mutations that take place on the X chromosome. If a female inherits a dystrophin mutation on one of her X chromosomes, she typically gets sufficient dystrophin from her functioning gene on the other X chromosome but will be a carrier for the disease (Mendell, 2012; Moat, 2013).</p><p>While disease progression is variable, muscle weakness is usually noticeable in early childhood. Early signs may include delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk and problems learning to speak. Individuals may be wheelchair-dependent by adolescence. The loss of strength in active breathing muscles leads to respiratory insufficiency and the need for ventilation in the teenage years. Affected individuals infrequently survive beyond the third decade, with respiratory complications and progressive cardiomyopathy being the most common causes of death (Bello, 2026; Landfeldt, 2020; McDonald, 2018; Szabo,2022).</p><p>Currently there is no cure for DMD, but improvements in treatment care and management are able to slow disease progression and improve quality of life, thereby prolonging life expectancy for affected individuals (Darras, 2022; Deng, 2022).</p><p><strong>Gene Therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)</strong></p><p style="margin-right:4px">Delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl (ELEVIDYS [Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. Cambridge, MA]) is a gene therapy for individuals with DMD, approved by the FDA on June 22, 2023 for the treatment of ambulatory pediatric patients aged 4 through 5 years with DMD with a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene. ELEVIDYS is administered as a one-time gene transfer infusion using the adeno-associated virus serotype rh74 (rAAVrh74) vector to deliver the micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue. Cells that receive the modified gene produce a micro-dystrophin (a shortened form of the naturally occurring dystrophin protein). Researchers believe that recipients of the modified dystrophin gene will have a milder, Becker-type muscular dystrophy phenotype.</p><p><strong>Clinical Trial SRP-9001-101 (NCT03375164)</strong></p><p>At the time of this review, only a single study evaluating the safety of the administration of SRP-9001 in boys with DMD (NCT 03375164) has been published. In this open-label, phase I/IIa, non-randomized, controlled trial, Mendell and colleagues (2020) reported on the safety and tolerability of intravenous rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin in individuals with DMD at 52 weeks following treatment. Researchers assessed the number of participants with adverse events following the IV administration of rAAVrh74.MHCK7 micro-dystrophin for the treatment of DMD. Secondary outcome measures included: Gross Motor Subtest Scaled (Bayley-III) Score; 100-meter timed test; change from baseline of micro-dystrophin gene expression quantification as measured by immunofluorescence; and baseline of micro-dystrophin gene expression quantification as quantified by Western blot test.</p><p>A total of four male, ambulatory participants with DMD, without preexisting AAVrh74 antibodies and a stable corticosteroid dose (for 12 or more weeks) and between the ages of 4 to 7 years of age who met eligibility criteria were enrolled. All participants were sufficiently ambulatory to complete several motor assessments. Muscle function was evaluated using the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), a 17-item measure of ambulatory functions with a score range of 0 (unable) to 34 (perfect score). Other functional outcomes evaluated included time to rise from floor, time to ascend four steps, 100-meter timed test, and handheld dynamometry for knee extensors and flexors as well as elbow extensors and flexors (Mendell, 2020).</p><p>On day 1 of the trial, all participants received 2.0&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;10<sup>14</sup> vg/kg rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin infusion. A total of 53 adverse events were reported of which 33 (62%) were considered mild or 20 (38%) moderate. While no serious adverse events were reported, 18 adverse events were deemed treatment related, the most common of which was vomiting (9 of 18 events [50%]). Three participants had transiently elevated &gamma;-glutamyltransferase, which resolved with corticosteroids. At 12 weeks, immunohistochemistry of gastrocnemius muscle biopsy specimens demonstrated transgene expression in all participants, with a mean of 81.2% of muscle fibers expressing micro-dystrophin. Western blot revealed a mean expression of 74.3% without fat or fibrosis adjustment and 95.8% with adjustment. At enrollment, the participants&rsquo; mean (standard deviation [SD]) NSAA score was 20.5 (3.7) points. The 1-year NSAA score improved 7, 8, 2 and 5 points (mean, 5.5 points) in participants 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. All subjects had confirmed vector transduction and reduced creatine kinase levels (posttreatment vs baseline) that were maintained for 1 year. The authors concluded that the study demonstrated rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin could be delivered safely and resulted in no major adverse events. Surrogate markers (expression of micro-dystrophin protein and decreased creatine kinase levels) were also demonstrated (Mendel, 2020).</p><p style="margin-right:-2px">Although the results of NCT 03375164 demonstrated that the 1-year NSAA score improved by a mean of 5.5 points, it is important to note that a clinically meaningful difference in NSAA scores (approximately 10-point change) was not reached (Ricotti, 2016). As noted in the FDA Briefing document, in general, individuals with DMD show improvements on the NSAA until about age 6, and then begin to decline. In this study, SRP-9001 treatment began at age 4, during the period of time when DMD subjects would be expected to be improving. It is also worth noting that NSAA results can be affected both by the consistency of administration (process-dependent) and by the effort of the participant and/or encouragement or coaching received from a family member, caregiver, or medical team (effort-dependent). Therefore, blinding to treatment assignment is needed in order to not influence the results in clinical studies employing the NSAA. Larger controlled studies with longer follow-up that demonstrate clinically meaningful improvement in functionality are needed (U.S. FDA 2023a).</p><p><strong>Clinical Trial SRP-9001-102 (NCT03769116)</strong></p><p>As part of the unpublished data that was submitted to the FDA in support of the BLA, in SRP-9001-102 (Study 102), researchers reported the topline results of an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter, 3-part clinical study in 41 ambulatory individuals with DMD with either a confirmed frameshift mutation, or a premature stop codon mutation between exons 18 to 58 in the DMD gene. All participants were &ge; 4 and &lt; 8 years of age at time of infusion in Part 1. The primary objectives of this 3-part study were to evaluate SRP-9001 dystrophin expression from SRP-9001 at 12 weeks post infusion (Part 1) as measured by western blot of biopsied muscle tissue expressed as a percent of control (levels of dystrophin in normal subjects without DMD or Becker muscular dystrophy [BMD]) and to evaluate the effect of SRP-9001 on physical function as assessed by the NSAA over 48 weeks. In Part 1, participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either a single intravenous infusion of SRP-9001 (n=20) or placebo (n=21). The study met its primary biological endpoint of micro-dystrophin protein expression. At Week 12 of Study 102 Part 1, the mean (SD) change from baseline levels of micro-dystrophin (% of control) were 3.6 (5.7), 28.2 (52.2), and 43.4 (48.6) for subjects receiving SRP-9001-dose level 1 (DL1), SRP-9001-dose level 2 (DL2), and SRP-9001-dose level 3 (DL3), respectively. The study did not demonstrate a statistically significant change in NSAA from baseline to Week 48 after treatment (U.S. FDA 2023a).</p><p>Age is known to be a critical prognostic factor in the progression of DMD. The Applicant conducted a subgroup analysis to further evaluate the treatment effect of SRP-9001 on NSAA scores from baseline to Week 48 by stratifying participants into two age groups: 4-5 years old and 6-7 years old. The exploratory subgroup analyses demonstrated that for individuals in the age 4-5 years cohort, the least square (LS) mean changes (standard error [SE]) in NSAA total score from baseline to Week 48 were 4.3 (0.7) and 1.9 (0.7) points for the SRP-9001 and placebo group, respectively. For participants 6-7 years of age, the LS mean changes (SE) in NSAA total score from baseline to Week 48 were -0.2 (0.7) and 0.5 (0.7) points for the SRP-9001 and placebo group, respectively. The analyses suggested that subjects 4-5 years old receiving SRP-9001 did better than the participants receiving placebo; however, individuals 6 to 7 years old who received SRP-9001 demonstrated no improvement in NSAA, and did worse than those receiving placebo. This raises the questions of whether SRP-9001only benefits ambulatory subjects below a certain age or above some threshold functional status. The data suggests a potential benefit of treatment with SRP-9001 in the 4-5 years of age cohort, but potentially no benefit in individuals 6-7 years of age (U.S. FDA 2023a).</p><p>A significant limitation in Study 102 Part 1 resulted from shortcomings in dose determination, discovered following subsequent analysis that revealed three different doses of SRP-9001 were administered to the 20 participants in the active treatment group: 6 participants received one-half the intended dose, 6 participants received two-thirds the intended dose, and 8 participants received the full intended dose.</p><p>In Part 2, which was also blinded, participants who received placebo in Part 1 received SRP-9001 and those that received SRP-9001 received a placebo infusion. All subjects were followed for another 48 weeks while safety and efficacy were evaluated. Two participants had substantially high micro-dystrophin baseline values which, according to the Applicant, may have been caused by baseline expression of a nonfunctional truncated form of dystrophin resulting from participant&rsquo;s specific mutations. The two participant&rsquo;s micro-dystrophin expression results were excluded from analysis. At Week 12 of Part 2, the mean (SD) change from baseline levels of the micro-dystrophin (% of control) were 10.6 (17.0), 10.4 (14.7), and 43.5 (55.6) for participants receiving SRP-9001-DL1, SRP-9001-DL2, and SRP-9001- DL3, respectively. SRP-9001-treated participants from the placebo crossover group (n=20, aged 5-8 at time of dosing SRP-9001) scored a statistically significant 2.0 points higher on the mean NSAA at 48 weeks compared to propensity-score weighted external controls (p value=0.0009). Mean NSAA scores from these Part 2 participants improved 1.3 points from baseline for the SRP-9001-treated group, and the NSAA scores in the external control group (n=103) declined 0.7 points from baseline. The mean age of the subjects who received SRP-9001 was 7.24 years of age.</p><p><strong>Clinical Trial SRP-9001-103 (NCT04626674, Endeavor trial)</strong></p><p>Study 103 (ENDEAVOR) is an open-label, Phase 1b study evaluating the safety of and expression from SRP-9001 in males at least 3 years of age with DMD over a 5-year (260 weeks) period. The primary outcome is the change from baseline in the quantity of micro-dystrophin protein expression at week 12 as measured by western blot (time frame from baseline to week 12). Estimated study completion date is January 2028 (U.S. FDA 2023a).</p><p><strong>Clinical Trial SRP-9001-301 (NCT05096221, Embark trial)</strong></p><p>The Embark trial is a global Phase 3, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, Part 1 and a 52-week crossover Part 2 (participants who are randomized to the placebo arm in Part 1 will have an opportunity for treatment with gene transfer therapy in Part 2). The primary efficacy outcome measure in Study 301 Part 1 is the change in NSAA total score from baseline to Week 52. Study 301 is fully enrolled with 125 male participants with DMD, &ge; 4 to &lt; 8 years of age at time of SRP-9001 infusion in Part 1. The manufacturer proposes that Study 301 Part 1 serve as the confirmatory study should SRP-9001 receive accelerated approval. Topline results from Study 301 Part 1 are expected in the latter part of 2023. The projected study completion date is November 2024 (U.S. FDA 2023a).</p><p style="margin-right:58px"><strong>Micro-dystrophin as a Surrogate Biomarker</strong></p><p style="margin-right:-2px">In preparation for its Cellular Tissue and Gene Therapy Advisory Committee meeting, the FDA issued a briefing document. The document noted that, &ldquo;measurement of levels of Sarepta&rsquo;s micro-dystrophin in muscle tissue only provides information about expression of the transgene product in cells transduced by SRP-9001, rather than insight into a pharmacologic effect on a biomarker in the pathway of the disease&rdquo;. The FDA document cautioned that the wild-type (naturally occurring) dystrophin protein not only serves as a shock absorber, but may play an important scaffolding role and helps to recruit potassium, sodium and calcium channels as well as neuronal nitric oxide synthase (a protein known to play a role in the protection of muscle cells and in the control of local blood flow by antagonizing sympathetic vasoconstriction) and signaling proteins (for example, kinases). Sarepta&rsquo;s abbreviated micro-dystrophin lacks key regions such as those binding neuronal nitric oxide synthase and alpha-syntrophin, and the areas that recruit signaling molecules and ion channels. Therefore, it is unclear to what extent Sarepta&rsquo;s micro-dystrophin is functionally similar to wild-type dystrophin or to shortened forms of dystrophin in individuals with BMD (U.S. FDA 2023a).</p><p style="margin-right:58px"><strong>FDA Cellular Tissue and Gene Therapy Advisory Committee Findings</strong></p><p>On May 12, 2023, the FDA&rsquo;s Advisory Committee was presented clinical evidence, including clinical testimony from providers, and patients with DMD and their families. The sponsor presented materials supporting the argument that the expression of SRP-9001 in the participants&rsquo; cells was a reasonable endpoint likely to predict clinical benefit, that risks were monitorable and manageable, and that the totality of clinical evidence with appropriate clinical trial comparators was sufficient to support accelerated approval. The sponsor also reminded the committee that waiting for additional confirmatory data would guarantee additional muscle loss in children who might otherwise receive treatment. The available therapies that address the underlying cause of disease (four exon-skipping drugs) only treat a small percentage of individuals with DMD harboring specific gene mutations. At the conclusion of the meeting, the committee voted 8-6 to recommend accelerated approval.</p><p><strong>Potential Benefits, Risks, and Uncertainties of ELEVIDYS</strong></p><p>The potential benefits of gene therapy for DMD include a delay in disease progression, greater life expectancy and improved quality of life. While the overall results from clinical trials (SRP-9001-102) show only a modest response to treatment in the younger age group (age 4-5), treating physicians and parents report cases of exceptional responses.</p><p>The administration of ELEVIDYS is not without risk and some uncertainties. In clinical studies, elevated liver function tests (including increases in GGT, GLDH, ALT, AST, or total bilirubin) were commonly reported within 8 weeks following ELEVIDYS infusion. The majority of cases were asymptomatic, and all cases resolved spontaneously or with systemic corticosteroids and resolved without clinical sequelae within 2 months. There were no reported cases of liver failure. Practitioners are advised to perform liver enzyme test prior to the administration of ELEVIDYS and to monitor liver function with clinical exam, total bilirubin and GGT weekly for the first 3 months following ELEVIDYS infusion.</p><p>In clinical trials, immune-mediated myositis was also observed approximately 1 month following ELEVIDYS infusion in participants with deletion mutations involving exon 8 and/or exon 9 in the DMD gene. Symptoms included severe muscle weakness, including dysphagia, dyspnea and hypophonia. In a life-threatening case of immune-mediated myositis, symptoms resolved during in-patient hospital care, and while muscle strength gradually improved, it did not return to baseline level. It is believed that these immune reactions may be due to a T-cell based response from lack of self-tolerance to a particular region encoded by the transgene corresponding to exons 1-17 of the DMD gene. Currently, there are limited data available for ELEVIDYS treatment in subjects with mutations in the DMD gene in exons 1 to 17 and/or exons 59 to 71. Individuals with deletions in these particular regions may be at risk for a severe immune-mediated myositis reaction. The product label cautions that ELEVIDYS is contraindicated in subjects with any deletion in exon 8 and/or exon 9 in the DMD gene due to the elevated risk for a severe immune-mediated myositis reaction.</p><p>Another uncertainty is the possibility that individuals who take the product may not be able to receive another more effective gene therapy using the same vector in the future. It is also unclear whether individual factors, such as age at treatment and severity of disease are predictive of response, or whether the treatment provides a long-term, durable benefit. Furthermore, muscle cell turnover is likely to dilute production of micro-dystrophin protein expression over time (Elangkovan, 2021).</p><p><strong>Summary </strong></p><p>DMD is a progressive and fatal condition. Gene therapy has the potential to delay disease progression for DMD with a single treatment, and possibly provide a durable cure. The available peer-reviewed, published literature on the use of ELEVIDYS as a gene therapy treatment for DMD is limited to a single phase I/IIa trial with four participants. Other data presented with the accelerated approval application demonstrated improvements in surrogate biomarkers. Clinical improvement was limited to a subgroup analysis of 4-5 year olds based on NSAA scores. The paucity of clinical data and the short follow-up period raises concerns. Nevertheless, the lack of any other effective treatment, DMD&rsquo;s inexorable and universally fatal course, promising results from a small number of treated 4-5-year-old boys, and the experience of some treating physicians and patients, makes it reasonable to offer treatment to that group while awaiting outcomes from larger trials and long-term follow-up. As noted in an FDA News Release:</p><p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:58px">The FDA concluded that the data submitted by the applicant demonstrated that an increase in this surrogate endpoint (expression of Elevidys micro-dystrophin) is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in individuals 4 to 5 years of age with DMD who do not have significant pre-existing antibody titers against the AAV rh74 vector or have other contraindications based on the inclusion criteria of the clinical trials. In making this decision, the FDA considered the potential risks associated with the drug, the life-threatening and debilitating nature of the disease for these children, and the urgent unmet medical need (U.S.FDA 2023c).</p><p>While there are limited clinical data, sufficient scientific evidence permits reasonable conclusions that treatment with ELEVIDYS increases the expression of the ELEVIDYS micro-dystrophin protein in ambulatory DMD subjects aged 4 to 5 years with a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene in a manner that appears likely to improve physical function and mobility.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Background/Overview</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p><strong>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</strong></p><p>DMD is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, occurring almost exclusively in males, though females may infrequently be affected. DMD is completely penetrant in males. In heterozygous females, penetrance varies and may depend in part on patterns of X-chromosome inactivation. Approximately 30% of cases are due to new mutations and may occur in individuals who do not have a family history of DMD. DMD does not display a predilection for any race or ethnic group (Darras, 2022).</p><p>A diagnosis of DMD is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and specialized tests including molecular genetic tests. Molecular genetic tests (frequently using blood or muscle cell samples) involve the examination of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to identify single point mutations, deletions, or duplications. These techniques can also be used to diagnosis DMD prenatally. When genetic tests are not informative, tissue biopsy may reveal characteristic changes to muscle fibers. Creatine kinase testing can be used to confirm that muscle is inflamed or damaged, but cannot definitively diagnose DMD. Additionally, other techniques such as immunofluorescence, immunostaining, or Western blot (immunoblot) can be performed on muscle samples to identify the presence and levels of specific proteins within cells (Darras, 2022; NORD, 2016).</p><p>Standard therapies used to treat and manage DMD are aimed at the specific symptoms. Treatment options generally include physical therapy and active and passive exercise to build muscle strength and prevent contractures. Surgery may be recommended in select individuals to treat scoliosis or contractures. Braces may be employed to prevent the development of contractures. The use of mechanical aids (e.g., canes, braces, and wheelchairs) may be necessary to assist with ambulation. Corticosteroids may be used to slow the progression of muscle weakness in affected individuals and delay the loss of ambulation. Medications for cardiac function, as well as tracheostomy and assisted ventilation to support respiratory function may also be used (Darras, 2022; NORD, 2016).</p><p>More recently, the FDA approved the use of several exon skipping, disease-modifying treatments for a subset of individuals with specific DMD mutations. Exon skipping treatments allow the body to &quot;skip over&quot; errors in the dystrophin gene to make a shorter form of dystrophin. For example:</p><ul>	<li>Amondys 45 (casimersen) is indicated to treat individuals with DMD who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping (Amondys 45 2021). &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>	<li>Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) injection is indicated for individuals who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping (Exondys 51, 2016).</li>	<li>Viltepso (viltolarsen) and Vyondys 53 (golodirsen) are indicated to treat individuals with DMD who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping (Viltepso, 2020; Vyondys 53, 2021).</li></ul><p>For more information regarding disease-modifying and exon-skipping treatments for DMD (for example: casimersen [Amondys 45], viltolarsen [Viltepso], and golodirsen [Vyondys 53]), please refer to clinical pharmacy criteria.</p><p><strong>Gene Therapy for DMD</strong></p><p>Gene therapy, also known as gene replacement therapy, introduces or alters genetic material to replace the function of a missing or dysfunctional gene with the goal of lessening or eliminating a disease process that results from genetic dysfunction. A gene may be altered using a &ldquo;vector&rdquo; or a &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; which is often a virus that has been modified to remove disease-causing genes, or DNA may be changed using genome (gene) editing, a group of technologies that allows genetic material to be added, removed, or altered. There are different approaches to gene therapy including replacing a mutated gene with a healthy gene, inactivating a mutated gene not functioning correctly, or introducing a new gene.</p><p>Gene therapy clinical trials for DMD are currently underway. On June 22, 2023, the FDA approved the use of delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl (ELEVIDYS.) gene therapy for the treatment of ambulatory pediatric patients aged 4 through 5 years with DMD with a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Definitions</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>Ambulatory: Able to walk, with or without an assistive device, such as a cane or walker (in contrast to &ldquo;non-ambulatory&rdquo;: unable to walk and requiring use of a wheelchair on a regular basis).</p><p>Adeno-associated virus (AAV): A small virus that infects humans and is not known to cause disease.
