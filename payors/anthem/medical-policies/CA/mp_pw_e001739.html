No nationally recognized published guidelines recommend the use of such devices for any medical purpose.</p><p>Summers and colleagues (2023) evaluated outcomes of a home-based, remote clinician-controlled physical therapy device compared to standard physical therapy after total knee arthroplasty. The study included individuals following a primary total knee arthroplasty for primary or secondary osteoarthritis and excluded bilateral total knee arthroplasty, previous surgery on the ipsilateral knee, or deformity requiring higher level of implant constraint. (n=270). Individuals who had had bilateral total knee arthroplasty, previous surgery on the ipsilateral knee, or deformity requiring higher level of implant constraint were excluded. The study was a retrospective review of outcomes for a consecutive series of individuals from a single surgeon&rsquo;s practice in 6 months before and the 6 months after the practice adopted use of the home-based therapy device. The standard therapy group (n=135) were those who received arthroplasty in the 6 months before the adoption. The intervention group was comprised of those treated in the 6 months after the practice adopted the home-based, clinician-controlled therapy system (n=135). The standard therapy group received a minimum of 4 weeks of in person, outpatient therapy sessions 2-3 times per week. The home-based, clinician-controlled therapy system group received the in-home, remote physical therapy device and no additional physical therapy. The home-based, clinician-controlled therapy system group accumulated more therapy sessions than the standard therapy protocol group, averaging 2.9 sessions per day compared to 2-3 times per week. The home-based, clinician-controlled therapy system group had less pain after 2 weeks (6.2 versus 7.7), 6 weeks (3.6 versus 5.2), and 12 weeks (1.4 versus 2.9) compared to the standard therapy group (all with P &lt; .0001). Knee ROM was greater in the home-based, clinician-controlled therapy system group. After 2 weeks of therapy, total knee ROM was 97 degrees (range 69-122) in the home-based group compared to 83 degrees (range 45-102) in the standard therapy group (P &lt; .0001). At the 6 weeks follow up, the total knee ROM was 114.9 (range 88-131) in the home-based group compared to 98.1 (range 73-124) in the standard therapy group (P &lt; .0001). At 12 weeks, total knee ROM was 125.2 (range 103-135) in the home-based group compared to 117.6 (range 102-132) in the standard therapy group (P &lt; .0001). This study had multiple limitations. The asynchronous nature of the study and control interventions may have introduced confounding factors relating to treatment differences or external factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic occurring during the study period. A therapist met with each individual in the home-based group during the 2-, 6-, 12-week visits to measure their knee ROM with a goniometer. Therefore, the home-based, clinician-controlled therapy system group was not strictly telerehabilitation. Furthermore, the therapists who measured outcomes were not blinded to the rehabilitation protocols. The preoperative knee ROM was estimated visually by the surgeon and may not have been an accurate comparison with the postoperative measurements by goniometry. Results from this single-surgeon study may not be generalizable to broader practice. The authors concluded home-based, clinician-controlled therapy system group was superior to standard protocol therapy. Prospective randomized studies are needed to verify their conclusions.</p><p>At this time, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the use of rehabilitative devices with remote monitoring or adjustment capabilities provides any incremental health outcome benefit compared to the other widely accepted alternative therapies. Until such time, it is unclear if the use of this device provides any benefits beyond standard devices.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Background/Overview</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p><em>Post-operative rehabilitation after knee arthroplasty</em></p><p>Although it is generally accepted that rehabilitation following knee arthroplasty is essential to achieve optimal results, no single rehabilitation protocol has been established as the standard of medical practice. Moderate quality evidence suggests that multi-disciplinary rehabilitation may improve treatment outcomes. Rehabilitation programs in this setting typically address ROM, strengthening, gait, and modification of daily activities as needed. Unresolved questions remain about the optimal setting, intensity, and frequency of therapy sessions.</p><p><em>ROMTech PortableConnect<sup>&reg;</sup></em></p><p>The PortableConnect is a rehabilitative therapy device to increase ROM. It is similar in appearance and function to a recumbent exercise bicycle. An adaptive pedal adjusts the turning radius to the individual&rsquo;s current ROM. Used in conjunction with the ROMTech AccuAngle󠄘<sup>&reg;</sup> (see below), the device shares data on time used, effort, and ROM with a remote physician or therapist. The physician or therapist can remotely adjust settings such as active vs. passive motion, resistance, and pedal radius. The manufacturer asserts that the PortableConnect<sup>&reg;</sup> improves recovered ROM over a 3 to 6 week treatment course. No published scientific studies are available to verify this assertion.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identifies the PortableConnect device as an isokinetic testing and evaluation system intended for medical purposes, such as to evaluate, measure, and increase the muscle strength and ROM. The FDA classifies this type of devices as exempt from the premarket notification procedures.</p><p><em>ROMTech AccuAngle<sup>&reg; </sup></em></p><p>The AccuAngle<sup> </sup>measures knee extension and flexion and reports these data to the individual&rsquo;s app. It is placed on the side of the leg and uses Bluetooth technology to measure and report flexion and extension during each therapy session. It is used in conjunction with the PortableConnect<sup>&reg;</sup> device.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identifies the AccuAngle device as an AC-powered goniometer, a device intended to evaluate joint function by recording and measuring ranges of motion and forces exerted by a joint. The FDA classifies this type of devices as exempt from the premarket notification procedures.</p><p><em>Mechanical Offloading for Diabetic Foot Ulcer</em></p><p>Reducing pressure by mechanical offloading benefits ulcers subjected to frequent pressure and stress. Various types of offloading devices include shoe modifications, cast walkers, total contact cast and other devices aiding ambulation. Cast walkers are prefabricated brace designed to provide offloading capability and maintain contact fit.</p><p><em>Sensoria Health Diabetic Foot Ulcer Boot</em></p><p>The Sensoria diabetic foot ulcer boot monitors an individual&rsquo;s compliance to the clinician&rsquo;s prescribed stabilization and mechanical offloading rehabilitation protocol. Real-time updates on the individual&rsquo;s activities and for how long the boot is taken off is provided to the clinician.</p><p>At this time, there is no evidence published in the medical literature addressing the clinical utility of these device.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="height:21px; width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" height="21" width="100%"><strong>Coding</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p><em>The following codes for treatments and procedures applicable to this document are included below for informational purposes.
