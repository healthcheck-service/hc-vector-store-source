The results, to date, have demonstrated inconsistent conclusions, and the authors acknowledge the need for further study to elucidate the clinical utility of these test devices and which population groups would potentially benefit from their use (Boroojerdi, 2019; Cheung, 2011; Gebruers, 2010; Perez Lloret, 2010).</p><p>Several studies have investigated the use of smartphone-based remote monitoring technology with the use of accelerometer and gyroscope data to assess tremors.</p><p>In 2017, Zheng and colleagues published a study with the aim to use a smartwatch with a triaxial accelerometer, a smartphone, and a remote server to quantify tremor objectively during daily activities. The study enrolled 9 participants, but 1 participant&rsquo;s data was lost. The remaining 8 participants each had an average effective data collection time of 26 hours. Despite scattered data points, the authors calculated significant correlation between the participants&rsquo; Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS) self-assessment scores and the device (r=0.84, p&lt;0.001); the device&rsquo;s qualitative measurements and the participants&rsquo; self-assessment scores (r=0.97, p=0.032); the device&rsquo;s qualitative measurements and the neurologists&rsquo; standardized assessment scores (r=0.80, p=0.005); and the neurologists FTMTRS and participants&rsquo; FTMTRS mean auto-assessment scores (r=0.84, p=0.009). While this study had significant results, there were several limitations including small sample size, lack of control group or blinding, and incomplete data collection.</p><p>Lipsmeier and colleagues reported on the data of two independent smartphone-based remote monitoring studies (2018). One study was a 6-month phase 1b clinical drug trial with 44 individuals with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. The other was a 6-week observational study of 35 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Individuals received a smartphone with a mobile application pre-installed and a belt with a pouch in which to carry the smartphone. After training on the use of the smartphone and mobile application, individuals were instructed to complete six daily active tests (sustained phonation, rest tremor, postural tremor, finger-tapping, balance, and gait), then carry the smartphone throughout the remainder of the day for passive monitoring of daily activities, and lastly, charge the smartphone overnight. Once quality control was performed on the data collected, 15% of sustained phonation data (phonation not sustained for an adequate period) and 3% of all other active test data (for example, no walking during balance test) were removed. The data showed the individuals with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease completed 5135 active tests, which resulted in an average daily test completion of 3.5 out of 7 days per week and 61% of all possible test sessions. Active test features demonstrated moderate-to-excellent test-retest reliability (average intraclass correlation coefficient=0.84). A significant difference was found by all active tests and passive monitoring features in differentiating individuals with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease from healthy controls (p&lt;0.005). Except for sustained phonation, all active tests were significantly related to the corresponding International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society&ndash;Sponsored UPDRS clinical severity ratings (rest tremor, postural tremor, finger tapping, gait task: p&lt;0.05; balance task: p&lt;0.01). The authors stated, &ldquo;On passive monitoring, time spent walking had a significant (p=0.005) relationship with average postural instability and gait disturbance scores.&rdquo; This study had several significant findings; however, there were also several limitations. First, intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated with mean data rather than individual data, which may have led to falsely higher values. And second, the data used was extracted from two separate studies with different study designs.</p><p>In 2018, Mehrang and colleagues released the results of a retrospective data analysis of age- and gender-matched individuals with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (n=616) and controls (n=621). These individuals were part of the first phase of the larger mPower study conducted in 2015. All individuals were recruited remotely through their smartphones and inclusion criteria was very broad including being at least 18 years of age or older, in the United States, and proficient at reading and writing on the smartphone in English. The mPower study required individuals to participate in four different tests aimed to assess physical and mental abilities. One of the tests was a gait assessment test in which individuals had to walk 20 steps in a straight line while carrying their smartphone in their pocket or bag. Those individuals who completed at least one walking test and answered whether or not they had Parkinson&rsquo;s disease were age- and gender-matched using background data provided through the mPower study. The investigators found the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were all equal 0.7, which showed that individuals with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease could be differentiated from those without Parkinson&rsquo;s disease through the 20-step walking test. A major limitation to this study due to the retrospective design was the lack of data collected. Additionally, there was no information on the medications the individuals were taking, other diseases that could have impacted gait, or disease severity of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</p><p>Additional studies have investigated the clinical validity of accelerometric measurements to evaluate physical activity and gait variables in the elderly and in those with hip osteoarthritis using differing devices and methods of data analysis and reporting. The authors acknowledged the need for further research to standardize testing methods and data reporting that compare devices in clinical practice (Bento, 2012; Item-Glatthorn, 2012). There is a lack of published evidence evaluating the clinical utility of accelerometers as compared to conventional testing modalities.</p><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Background/Overview</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>There are multiple types of motion analysis accelerometers on the market for various applications including evaluation of physical exercise, weight reduction progress, and motion disorders, associated with certain conditions, such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. These devices attach to the individual&#39;s arm and other body parts to measure body motion. Once attached, the person is then asked to do several tasks, such as resting with their hands in their lap for several seconds, holding their arms straight out in front of them for several seconds, or extending their arm and touching their nose. Some models of these devices also include an electromyography (EMG) testing component.</p><p>One such device is the Kinesia<sup>&trade;</sup> (Great Lakes NeuroTechnologies, Cleveland, OH) which obtained clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 6, 2007 through the 510(k) approval process. The Kinesia device is indicated to:</p><ul style="list-style-type:disc">	<li>monitor physical motion and muscle activity to quantify the kinematics of movement disorder symptoms, such as tremor; and</li>	<li>assess activity in any instance where quantifiable analysis of motion and muscle activity is desired (FDA, 2007).</li></ul><p style="margin-right:34px">As technology has evolved, accelerometers and gyroscopes have been incorporated into smartphones and smartwatches, which allows analysis of motion through mobile applications. Performance of various tests, such as sitting to assess tremors and walking to assess balance and gait, while wearing such devices has been proposed as a method of testing for and managing tremor-related conditions.</p><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Definitions</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p style="text-align:justify">Accelerometer: A device that measures the change in position by detecting variations in motion or acceleration.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Clinical utility: An assessment of the risks and benefits resulting from using a particular test and the likelihood that the test will lead to an improved overall outcome.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Clinical validity: The accuracy with which a test identifies or predicts an individual&rsquo;s clinical status.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Gyroscope: A device composed of a spinning disc or light mechanism in a static frame.
