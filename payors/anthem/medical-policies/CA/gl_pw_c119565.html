The source for each of the indications listed above is indicated by the referenced citation.</p><p>Generally speaking, screening refers to an effort or program which is used to detect a condition in an asymptomatic individual so that early detection and treatment can be provided for those who test positive for the condition. Surveillance refers to the systematic identification and evaluation of individuals considered to be at increased risk for the occurrence or recurrence of a condition or disease (for example; colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps. Diagnostic testing is typically done to confirm or rule out a condition in an individual who is symptomatic or who, for some other reason, is believed to have a specific condition.</p><p>Several organizations have published recommendations for colorectal cancer screening and provided guidance on when colorectal cancer screening should be initiated. The U.S. Multi-Society Task Force of Colorectal Cancer (USMSTF), which represents the American College of Gastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological Association, and The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommends that African Americans at average risk for colorectal cancer begin screening at 45 years of age because of an increased incidence of colorectal cancer in this population (Rex, 2018). The collaborative guideline developed by the American Cancer Society, US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology as well as the USMSTF on Colorectal Cancer recommends that individuals at average risk for the development of colorectal cancer begin screening at 50 years of age (Levin, 2008, Rex, 2017). Similarly, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines on colorectal cancer screening recommend that colorectal cancer screening of average-risk individuals begin at age 45 years (NCCN, 2021).</p><p>In 2018, the American Cancer Society (ACS) included several recommendations regarding colorectal cancer screening. For individuals at average risk, the society issued a &ldquo;strong recommendation&rdquo; that screening being at age 50 using one of several screening techniques: colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, CT colonography, multi-target stool DNA testing, fecal immunochemical testing or high-sensitivity guaiac-based stool testing. The &ldquo;strong recommendation&rdquo; signifies that &ldquo;benefits of adherence to the intervention outweigh the undesirable effects and that most patients would choose the intervention&rdquo;. The society also recommended that individuals considered to be at average risk for colorectal cancer should begin screening at age 45 years. However, this was a &ldquo;qualified recommendation&rdquo; indicating that &ldquo;there is clear evidence of benefit (or harm) but less certainty either about the balance of benefits and harms or about patients&rsquo; values and preferences, which could lead to different individual decisions&rdquo;. In support of its &ldquo;qualified recommendation&rdquo;, the ACS cites SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) data which demonstrated a 22% relative increase (from 5.9 to 7.2 cases per 100,000 person-years) in the incidence of colorectal cancer between 2000 and 2013 for individuals between 40 to 49 years of age. However, other factors such as environmental influences, including but not limited to diet, and rising obesity rates, may have played a part in the increase in colorectal cancer in individuals between 45 to 49 years of age. Also, while it may be reasonable to assume that screening individuals younger than the age of 50 will produce similar results as screening individuals older than 50 years of age for colorectal cancer, the ACS recommendations did not provide any direct evidence of this assertion. Instead, the ACS recommendations were based on modeling studies on the natural history of colorectal neoplasia and the performance of colorectal screening. The authors of the ACS guidelines acknowledge that some assumptions must be made in order for the guidelines to improve population health. Some of these assumptions are that screening tests are as effective in younger individuals as in older individuals, that there will be 100% adherence to the screening recommendations (Wolf, 2018).&nbsp;</p><p>In response the to 2018 ACS recommendation that colorectal cancer (CRC) screening be initiated in average risk individuals beginning at age 45 years, the USMSTF released an updated statement on colorectal cancer screening. In the updated statement the USMSTF maintained its position that colorectal cancer screening for average-risk persons begin at age 45 years in African Americans and at age 50 years in other groups. In support of these recommendations, the USMSTF also stated that:</p><p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:53px">Evidence from screening studies to support lowering the screening age is very limited at this time. Based on the modeling study used to support the ACS recommendation, the MSTF recognizes that lowering the screening age to 45 may improve early detection and prevention of CRC. The MSTF expects the new ACS recommendation to stimulate investigation that will clarify the benefits and risks of earlier screening.</p><p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:53px">As the MSTF has previously noted and discussed, rates of colorectal cancer are increasing in Americans down to age 20 years. Beginning screening at 45 years addresses only part of the increasing risk of colorectal cancer in young persons. For all persons under 50 years, it remains critical to promptly assess symptoms consistent with colorectal cancer. In particular, rectal bleeding and unexplained iron deficiency anemia have substantial predictive value for colorectal cancer and should be thoroughly evaluated (USMSTF 2018)&nbsp;</p><p>The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF, 2021) guidelines on screening for colorectal cancer are unique in that they provide age-based guidance on when routine colonoscopy screening should be initiated and terminated. The updated USPSTF recommendations state that screening colonoscopy begin at age 45 years and continue to age 75 years. This is a change from the prior version, which indicated the lower threshold for screening colonoscopy as 50 years of age. The update is based on emerging evidence that colorectal cancer cases in persons younger than age 50 years have been slowly increasing (for reasons that are not entirely understood). According to the USPSTF, the number of individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age 45 years today is similar to the number of individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age 50 years in 1992. As part of the USPSTF review, an updated modelling study was commissioned to explore the benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening in adults younger than 50 years. According to the analysis, lowering the age of screening from 50 to 45 years results in approximately 2 to 3 additional cases and 1 additional death due to colorectal cancer being averted per 1,000 adults screened. The harms of screening, generally resulting from colonoscopy (such as bleeding and bowel perforation), either as the screening test or as follow-up for positive findings detected by other screening tests, have not been carefully evaluated in younger individuals, but are estimated by the USPSTF to be &ldquo;small&rdquo;. For individuals 76 to 85 years of age, the USPSTF concluded that the benefits of screening for colorectal cancer diminish while the risk of experiencing serious associated harms increase. Therefore, the decision to screen for colorectal cancer in individuals between 76 and 85 years of age &ldquo;should be an individual one, taking into account the patient&rsquo;s overall health and prior screening history&rdquo;. For this group, the USPSTF has indicated that &ldquo;screening would be most appropriate among adults who (1) are healthy enough to undergo treatment if colorectal cancer is detected and (2) do not have comorbid conditions that would significantly limit their life expectancy&rdquo;. The USPSTF recommends against the use of colorectal cancer screening in adults 85 years of age or older (USPSTF, 2016).</p><p>Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for colon cancer surveillance. Surveillance intervals (which provide guidance on how frequently a colonoscopy should be repeated), are based upon the individual&#39;s risk factors (for example, the individual&rsquo;s personal medical history, family history of colorectal cancer and the results of earlier colonoscopies). Surveillance with earlier and more frequent colonoscopy is recommended for individuals who are at increased risk for colorectal cancer.</p><p>Due to advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, multigene tests which simultaneously analyze a set of genes that are associated with a specific family cancer phenotype or multiple phenotypes are being explored as a means to create colonoscopy surveillance recommendations. With regards to using multigene testing to develop colonoscopy surveillance recommendations, the NCCN has indicated it &ldquo;recognizes that data to support the surveillance recommendations for these particular genes are evolving at this time&rdquo; and that &ldquo;caution should be used when implementing final colonoscopy surveillance regimens in context of patient preferences and new knowledge that may emerge&rdquo; (NCCN, Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment Colorectal, 2023).</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>References</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><ol>	<li>Agrawal S, Bhupinderjit A, Bhutani MS, et al.
