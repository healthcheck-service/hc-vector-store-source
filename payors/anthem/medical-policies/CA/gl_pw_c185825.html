When identified early, cervical cancer can be treated and results in high survival rates. The 5-year relative survival rate for localized cervical cancer is 92% (ACS, 2023b).</p><p>Cervical cancer screening is comprised of cervical cytology with Papanicolaou testing (also known as a &lsquo;Pap smear&rsquo; or &ldquo;Pap test&rdquo;) and testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA. Pap tests are used to identify pre-cancerous or cancerous cells present on the cervix. When such cells are found, excision treatments can be used to completely remove the cancerous tissue. The detection of HPV DNA is used as an indication of the cancerous potential of a lesion and the potential risk of developing cervical cancer in the future. According to the ACS, nearly all cases of cervical cancer test positive for HPV DNA. However, not all HPV types result in the development of cervical cancer. Two types of HPV, type 16 and type 18 have been found to be associated with 65% to 75% of all cervical cancers. Another 10 HPV types are associated with the remaining cases.</p><p>The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF, 2018) recommends regular cervical cancer screening for eligible individuals aged 21 to 65 years old (Grade A recommendation). Cervical cancer screening every 3 years with cervical cytology alone is recommended in individuals aged 21 to 29 years. For individuals aged 30 to 65 years, any of the following screening options are recommended:</p><ul>	<li>every 3 years with cervical cytology; or</li>	<li>every 5 years with primary high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing; or</li>	<li>every 5 years with both hrHPV testing and with cytology (co-testing).</li></ul><p>The evidence summary upon which the guideline was based (Melnikow, 2018) stated that there was consistent evidence from clinical trials that primary hrHPV screening increased detection of cervical abnormalities (i.e., high-grade dysplasia or more severe) in the initial round of screening by approximately 2 to 3 times compared with cytology alone.</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) (2021) and the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) (2021) have endorsed the 2018 USPSTF guidelines. The 2021 ACOG Practice Advisory replaced the organization&rsquo;s 2016 Practice Bulletin.</p><p>The USPSTF (2018) guideline recommends (Grade A recommendation) cervical cancer screening for average risk individuals beginning at age 21. This age criterion is based on data that cervical cancer before age 21 is rare, disease progression is slow, and there is high likelihood that abnormal cervical cytology in individuals less than 21 would regress. As such, the task force consensus that screening individuals less than 21 years of age could result in more harm than benefit is based on the potential of overtreatment contributing to future adverse pregnancy outcomes.</p><p>In addition, the USPSTF (2018) guideline recommends beginning HPV testing at age 30. The USPSTF recommendations refer both to primary HPV testing and HPV co-testing. Several HPV test kits have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as primary HPV tests in individuals age 25 and older. These include the Cobas<sup>&reg;</sup> HPV test (Roche Diagnostics), which was approved in 2014 as a primary screening test (previously approved as co-test along with cervical cytology) the Onclarity<sup>&trade;</sup> HPV assay (Beckton, Dickenson and Company), which was FDA-approved in 2018. A number of other test kits have been approved for co-testing with cervical cytology (Fontham, 2020).</p><p>There is a Grade D recommendation (meaning, the USPSTF recommends against routinely providing to asymptomatic individuals and found at least fair evidence that testing is ineffective or that harms outweigh benefits) against cervical screening in the following populations:</p><ul>	<li>Individuals younger than 21 years of age;</li>	<li>Women who have had a hysterectomy;</li>	<li>Women older than 65 years of age.</li></ul><p>In July 2020, the ACS published an updated cervical cancer screening guideline recommending cervical cancer screening beginning at age 25 (Fontham, 2020). For individuals aged 25 to 65, the ACS recommends a primary HPV test specifically approved as a primary screening test by the FDA every 5 years. If primary HPV testing is not available, they recommend either screening with an HPV test and Pap test every 5 years or cervical cytology every 3 years. As was the case in the development of other guidelines, the committee considered the balance of likely benefits and harms according to the age at screening initiation. The ACS recommendation used the same decision model as the USPSTF 2018 recommendation, which suggests that decreasing the age of HPV testing from 30 to 25 will result in additional colposcopies, but more life-years saved. The ACS recommendations reflect the impact of HPV vaccination, first introduced in 2007 and the entry of vaccinated cohorts, now in their 20s, into the screening-eligible age range. Cytology-based screening is much less efficient in vaccinated populations, as abnormal cytology disproportionately identifies minor abnormalities resulting from HPV types that are associated with lower cancer risk.</p><p>The 2021 ACOG Practice Advisory included the following statement regarding the 2020 ACS guidelines:</p><p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:58px">Despite the demonstrated efficacy and efficiency of primary hrHPV testing, uptake of this screening method has been slow because of the limited availability of FDA-approved tests and the significant laboratory infrastructure changes required to switch to this screening platform. Limited access to primary hrHPV testing is of particular concern in rural and under-resourced communities and among communities of color, which have disproportionately high rates of cervical cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality. Although cytology-based screening options are still included in the ACS guidelines in acknowledgement of these barriers to widespread access and implementation, ACS strongly advocates phasing out cytology-based screening options in the near future. Until primary hrHPV testing is widely available and accessible, cytology-based screening methods should remain options in cervical cancer screening guidelines. Although HPV self-sampling has the potential to greatly improve access to cervical cancer screening, and there is an increasing body of evidence to support its efficacy and utility, it is still investigational in the United States.</p><p><strong>Special populations</strong></p><p><em>HIV-infection</em><br />In 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in their Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV, published an updated recommendation on cervical cancer screening for individuals who are HIV-positive. The document states, &ldquo;new recommendation for cervical cancer screening to start at age 21 based on the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study with no reported cases of cervical cancer below the age of 25.&rdquo; The guideline cited the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study which analyzed data from a population of 164,084 women with HIV and found no cases of invasive cervical cancer in women under 25 years-old over 69,900 person-years of follow-up (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0 to 7.1). SIR is a ratio of the observed incidence of a disease to the expected incidence of a disease in the general population. The authors stated, &ldquo;The rationale for beginning screening at age 21 is to provide a 3- to 5-year window prior to age 25, when the risk of ICC in WWH [women with HIV] exceeds that of the general population.&rdquo; Match study data were published by Stier and colleagues in 2021.</p><p><em>Immunosuppression without HIV-infection</em><br />In 2019, Moscicki and colleagues published an expert panel guideline on cervical cancer screening recommendations for immunocompromised women without HIV infection. The document noted that the relevant literature was reviewed and, given the small amount of data available, recommendations were &ldquo;largely based on expert opinion&rdquo;. For individuals who have had solid organ transplants or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants, cervical cytology is recommended for individuals under age 30. For individuals 30 years of age or older, co-testing with HPV is preferred, but cytology alone is acceptable. If cytology alone is used, annual testing is recommended unless the results of 3 consecutive tests are negative, in which case cytology can be performed every 3 years. If co-testing with HPV is performed, a baseline co-test with cytology and HPV is recommended and, if the cytology test is normal and HPV is negative, co-testing can be performed every 3 years. If transplants occur before the individual is 21 years old, the recommendation is to begin screening within 1 year of sexual debut.</p><p>The Moscicki publication cited an analysis of the U.S. Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (USSRTR) study (Madeleine, 2013). This analysis reported on the incidence of HPV-related cancers in a cohort of 187,679 solid organ transplant recipients. Risk data were presented in standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), which is a ratio of the observed incidence of a disease to the expected incidence of a disease in the general population. The reported SIR was 3.3 (95% CI, 2.6 to 4.2) for <em>in situ</em> cervical cancer, and 1.0 (95% CI, 0.8 to 1.3) for invasive cervical cancer. This indicated a greater than 3-fold increased risk of <em>in situ</em> cervical cancers and no increased risk for invasive cancers. Additionally, compared to subjects 50 years of age and older, subjects 18 to 34 years of age had a significantly greater risk of <em>in situ</em> cervical cancer (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=4.7). The median age at diagnosis was 38 years for <em>in situ</em> cervical cancer and 44.5 years for invasive cervical cancer and the median time from transplant to cervical diagnosis was 2.6 years for <em>in situ</em> cervical cancer and 3.8 years for invasive cervical cancer.</p><p><em>Diethylstilbestrol (DES)</em><br />The NIH (2021) recommends an annual medical examination that includes a pelvic examination and a Pap test that analyzes cells gathered from the cervix and the vagina for women who were exposed to DES <em>in utero</em>. DES use was discontinued in the United States in the 1970s and thus there are no longer any women who were exposed to DES <em>in</em> <em>utero</em> who are under 21 years old.</p><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Definitions</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>High-risk human papillomavirus (HrHPV): Types of HPV that have been linked to an increased risk of cervical cancer.
