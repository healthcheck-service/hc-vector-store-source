The FPI is based on liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCM/MS) analysis of urine for 11 endogenous analytes (methylmalonic acid, xanthurenic acid, homocysteine, pyroglutamic acid, vanilmandelate, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, hydroxymethylglutarate, ethylmalonate, 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid [3-HPMA], quinolinic acid, kynurenic acid).

These laboratory tests measure urine biomarkers known to be associated with pain and may be used as part of a pain-specific work-up. Pain Biomarker Assessment provides insight into the possible origins of neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and altered pain perception. According to the manufacturer, Ethos Laboratories, &ldquo;Correction of abnormal levels of functional pain biomarkers using safe, cost-effective therapies could increase the likelihood of successful and prolonged chronic pain management.&rdquo; Ethos laboratories also claims the ability to provide personalized recommendations for adjunctive therapy based on the test results, &ldquo;Uncovering the biochemical origins of a patient&rsquo;s chronic pain can suggest relevant, personalized treatment approaches.&rdquo; The analytes included in this functional biomarker testing can be classified as markers of the following:</p><ul>	<li>Chronic inflammation;</li>	<li>Nerve health;</li>	<li>Neurotransmitter status;</li>	<li>Oxidative stress.</li></ul><p>Ethos laboratories has based its efficacy on a single retrospective observational study of 17,834 subjects with chronic pain. Results claim that 77% of these subjects with chronic pain exhibited at least one abnormal pain biomarker. In contrast, among healthy people with no history of chronic pain or opioid use, only up to 5% exhibited one or more of these abnormal biomarkers. The most common abnormal biomarker finding was elevated quinolinic acid, which was observed in 29% of subjects (n=5107). Elevated pyroglutamate, indicative of glutathione depletion, was observed in 19% of subjects (n=3314). Elevated xanthurenic acid, indicative of vitamin B6 insufficiency, was observed in 17% of subjects (n=3025). Elevated levels of the acrolein metabolite 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid was observed in 21% of subjects (n=3667). Elevated methylmalonic acid, indicative of a vitamin B12 deficiency, was observed in 10% of subjects (n=1827), whereas abnormally low levels of neurotransmitter metabolites were observed in 8% of subjects (n=1456). The investigators noted that a limitation of this study was that medications and conditions other than those associated with chronic pain were not evaluated as potential causes of abnormal biomarker findings (Gunn, 2020).</p><p>There is a lack of evidence in the peer-reviewed published medical literature of the clinical validity and utility of this test. Ethos laboratories also claims the ability to provide personalized recommendations for adjunctive therapy based on the test results, &ldquo;Uncovering the biochemical origins of a patient&rsquo;s chronic pain can suggest relevant, personalized treatment approaches.&rdquo; However, further study with large, well-designed trials are needed to elucidate the true value of these test findings, as it relates to conventional pain management strategies.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Background/Overview</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>The Foundation Pain Index (PI<sup>℠</sup>) is intended for use in adults being treated for chronic pain when the treating clinician is attempting to determine the underlying pathogenesis of the pain, attempting to minimize or lower opioid dependence, or wanting to identify targeted, non-opioid therapies for the individual. Specifically, individuals with chronic pain of unknown etiology, new subjects presenting with pain, and those with established chronic pain diagnoses being managed on opioid therapy represent the intended use population for Foundation PI<sup>℠</sup>. An algorithm is then reported as a Pain Index Score (PIS) with projected likelihood of atypical biochemical function associated with pain. Ethos laboratories claims that individual test results, both current and historic, would potentially enable providers to identify changes in an individual&rsquo;s functional biomarkers over time and in response to treatment. The Ethos laboratory purports intended indications would include:</p><ul>	<li>Identification and validation of objective biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain;</li>	<li>With the potential to reshape pain management paradigms, improve patient outcomes, reduce opioid reliance, cut healthcare costs, and further the pursuit of personalized medicine (Ethos Laboratories).</li></ul><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Definitions</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>Mass Spectrometry: An analytical tool useful for measuring the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of one or more molecules present in a sample.
