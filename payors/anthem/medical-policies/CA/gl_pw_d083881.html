DLI, which is also referred to as donor leukocyte or buffy coat transfusion, is a form of adoptive immunotherapy and attempts to induce a beneficial GVL or graft-versus-tumor (GVT) response without the need for an additional bone marrow harvest from the donor or further high-dose chemotherapy for the recipient. Collection of donor leukocytes requires the original donor to undergo a leukapheresis procedure. After collection, these cells are infused into the recipient either immediately or after frozen storage.</p><p>Leukapheresis is the removal of white blood cells from blood that is drawn directly from a blood vessel in the arm or through a small tube (catheter) placed in a single vein. The blood goes through a centrifuge where white blood cells, along with some platelets and a small amount of red blood cells, are removed. The remainder of the cells and plasma will pass through the centrifuge and will then be returned to the donor through a needle or catheter that is placed in the opposite arm. The procedure is performed in the outpatient setting and takes 2 to 3 hours to complete. DLI is used as an alternative to a second hematopoietic cell transplant.</p><p>DLI has been researched as a treatment for a variety of hematologic malignancies, including most prominently chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but also acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin disease, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Studies are limited due to small numbers but they have provided evidence that DLI can establish a graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma effect.</p><p>There is clear clinical evidence that DLI can eradicate and cure relapsed CML. In addition, infusions using lymphocytes obtained from the original hematopoietic progenitor cell donor can induce long-term, complete, hematological, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic remissions in individuals treated for relapsing CML after an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network<sup>&reg;</sup> (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG, V.1.2023) for CML state &ldquo;Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is effective in inducing durable molecular remissions in the majority of patients with relapsed CML following allogeneic HCT, though it is more effective in patients with chronic phase relapse than advanced phase relapse.&rdquo; These recommendations were based on 2A category of evidence and uniform consensus. The results from CML may be extrapolated to individuals with relapsed AML, since there is evidence of a graft-versus-leukemia effect in individuals with AML treated with allogeneic transplants.</p><p>Therapy is also effective for relapse of hematologic malignant diseases other than CML, although response rates are lower. The medical evidence currently available for the use of DLI in individuals with relapsed disease from other hematologic malignancies including, but not limited to, ALL, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin disease and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, consists mostly of multiple small case series. However, there is a preponderance of these smaller studies that in conjunction, demonstrate that DLI may induce an anti-tumor response in individuals who have relapsed disease following an allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant.</p><p>Beitinjaneh and colleagues (2012) reported a higher response rate and longer overall survival when DLI was used preemptively in individuals treated with allogeneic HCT as a treatment for multiple myeloma. Between July 1996 and June 2008, 23 individuals with multiple myeloma received DLI, 8 as preemptive DLI for residual disease (RD) and 15 as DLI for the treatment of recurrent or progressive disease (PD). With a median follow-up of 24 months, 5 of 23 individuals (22%) achieved a complete response (CR) or a very good partial response (2 CR, 3 very good partial response [VGPR]), and stable disease (SD) in 8 individuals (34%) after DLI. A higher response rate (&ge; VGPR 50% vs. 7%, p=0.03), a longer overall survival (28.3 vs. 7.6 months, p=0.03) and a trend toward longer progression-free survival (11.9 vs. 5.2 months, p=0.1) were reported in individuals who received DLI for RD. Five individuals (22%) had Grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The authors concluded the preemptive use of DLI after an allogeneic HSCT for multiple myeloma may be associated with improved outcomes. Additional clinical trials are encouraged to identify the optimal timing for DLI.</p><p>The NCCN CPGs for multiple myeloma (V.3.2023) include the use of DLI in individuals with unresponsive or relapsed disease after allogeneic hematopoietic cell grafting in order to stimulate a beneficial graft-versus-myeloma effect. Similarly, the NCCN CPGs for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (V1.2022) state that, &ldquo;For patients with relapsed disease after allogeneic HCT, a second HCT and/or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) can be considered.&rdquo;</p><p>Sala and colleagues (2014) reported results from a retrospective series of 18 individuals with relapsed and/or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma after allogeneic HSCT that were treated with a combination of bendamustine followed by DLI. Nine of the participants were eligible for DLI after bendamustine, based on the pre-specified criteria. A median of two DLIs were infused into the individuals. Adverse events from the DLI included 3 individuals with chronic GVHD and 3 cases of Grade IV acute GVHD. Acute hospitalization was required for 3 individuals with acute GVHD. Of those treated with DLI, CR was seen in 3 individuals and PR in 7 individuals, for an overall response rate (ORR) of 55% with a 9-month (range 1-26 months) median duration of response. For the 18 participants, the median overall survival was 11 months (range 1-52 months) and the progression-free survival (PFS) was 6 months (range, 1-28 months). The authors noted the combination of bendamustine followed by DLI demonstrated a response. However, a randomized trial is needed to determine if the treatment effect was due to the bendamustine compared to the DLI or the combination.</p><p>Thomson and colleagues (2010) reported multicenter results of 82 individuals with follicular lymphoma that were treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. All individuals with mixed chimerism or residual or progressive disease were eligible for DLI. Thirteen participants received 25 DLIs with remission in 10 individuals (77%). At a median of 44 months after the last DLI, the ongoing complete response seemed durable. There was no response in 3 individuals treated with DLI. The authors concluded the frequency and duration of response demonstrated was an &ldquo;encouraging strategy to treat follicular lymphoma.&rdquo;</p><p>GVHD is a common occurrence with DLI. As a result, studies continue to investigate various dosing, timing of DLI infusions, and new approaches, including modifications to T-lymphocytes to minimize GVHD complications. The level of evidence is insufficient to permit conclusions in terms of uses of DLI for other than hematologic malignancies that have relapsed following a prior allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant or to permit conclusions regarding the use of genetic modification (e.g., modified T-lymphocytes) of donor lymphocytes in the treatment of hematologic malignancies.</p><p>However, in a study by Alho and colleagues (2016), the authors observed that the &ldquo;development and maintenance of immune tolerance after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation requires the balanced reconstitution of donor-derived CD4 regulatory T cells (CD4Tregs) as well as effector CD4 (conventional CD4 T cells [CD4Tcons]) and CD8 T cells.&rdquo; They studied 107 adult subjects who received &ldquo;T-replete stem cell grafts after reduced-intensity conditioning who were monitored&rdquo; over a 2-year period. The authors found that the imbalances assisted in the &ldquo;production, expansion, and persistence of effector T cells over CD4Tregs and were associated with the development of chronic GVHD.&rdquo;</p><p>There is also research interest in the genetic modification of donor lymphocytes. For example, it has been proposed that donor lymphocytes can be modified by insertion of a thymidine kinase gene, rendering the cells susceptible to ganciclovir therapy. If the infusion of the genetically modified donor lymphocytes results in severe graft vs. host disease, the transplant recipient can then be treated with ganciclovir to selectively destroy the donor lymphocytes. Other editing techniques may involve disrupting the GVHD process by targeting T-cell receptors and cell surface expression or the genetic editing to evade host-mediated rejection (Qasim, 2023). However, further investigation and data regarding the safety and efficacy of genetic modifications of DLI on GVHD and/or graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) are needed.</p><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Definitions</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>Allogeneic: Genetically dissimilar; involves a donor and recipient.</p><p>Bone marrow: A soft, spongy tissue that fills the cavities inside most bones in the human body.
