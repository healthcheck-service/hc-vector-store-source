A Group 3 pressure reducing support surface (for example, air-fluidized bed) is a device employing the circulation of warm filtered air through small, silicone coated ceramic beads creating the characteristics of fluid. When the individual is placed in the bed, his or her body weight is evenly distributed over a large surface area, which creates the sensation of &ldquo;floating.&rdquo;</p><p class="MsoBodyText3" style="margin-right:-2px">For all types of support surfaces, the support surface provided should be one in which the individual does not &ldquo;bottom out.&rdquo; Bottoming out is the finding that an outstretched hand, placed palm up between the undersurface of the overlay or mattress and the individual&rsquo;s bony prominence (coccyx or lateral trochanter), can readily palpate the bony prominence. This bottoming out criterion should be tested with the individual in the supine position with their head flat, in the supine position with their head slightly elevated (no more than 30 degrees), and in the side lying position.</p><p class="MsoBodyText3" style="margin-right:-2px">In a meta-analysis by Nicosia and colleagues (2007) the authors concluded data support the use of foam mattresses, air mattresses or overlays versus a standard hospital mattress to reduce the risk of developing heel pressure ulcers. However, the authors noted the results are limited based on the small number and poor quality of controlled clinical trial data included in the meta-analysis.</p><p class="MsoBodyText3" style="margin-right:-2px">One Cochrane review (McInnes, 2015) concluded that individuals at high risk for developing pressure ulcers should use higher specification foam mattresses (mattresses which contour to the body) rather than standard hospital foam mattresses. Another Cochrane review (McInnes, 2018) looked at 19 trials of support surfaces for treatment of pressure ulcers. The authors concluded that &ldquo;it is unclear whether any particular type of low- or high-tech support surface is more effective at healing pressure ulcers than standard support surfaces&rdquo; and further studies are required to determine which support surfaces are most effective in the treatment of pressure ulcers.</p><p class="MsoBodyText3" style="margin-right:-2px">A 2013 literature review by White-Chu and colleagues looked at 14 articles which addressed the prevention of pressure ulcers in individuals with advanced illness. These articles included one systematic review, one randomized control trial, three prospective trials, two retrospective cohort trials, one cost-effective analysis, one quality improvement study, one comparative descriptive design trial, and four review articles. The systematic review evaluated the use of any support surfaces for the prevention of pressure ulcers and concluded that a higher specification mattress is more likely to prevent pressure ulcers compared to standard hospital mattresses. The randomized controlled trial evaluated frequent positioning as a method to prevent pressure ulcers. This trial did not reach its participant enrollment target. Three prospective trials evaluated different modalities (repositioning, support surfaces, and skin integrity maintenance) for the prevention of pressure ulcers. One of the prospective trials showed the incidence of pressure ulcers was 0% for individuals on a low air loss mattress and 18% for individuals on an integrated power pressure redistribution bed. However, the integrated power pressure redistribution beds were 7 years old and the low air loss beds were brand new. The two retrospective cohort trials evaluated repositioning techniques and risk assessment. One of the retrospective trials found that repositioning every 2 hours did not decrease the incidence of pressure ulcers. The quality improvement study focused on skin integrity and incontinence issues using a barrier product for incontinence, using aqueous cream instead of soap and dermal pads over previous pressure ulcer sites. This study reported a reduction in pressure ulcer prevention from 14% to 1.28% in 6 months. However, this study did not analyze statistical significance. The comparative description design trial looked at 20 participants and the impact of repositioning on blood flow. They reported that blood flow to bony prominences decreased when an individual was in the 30&deg; lateral position as opposed to the supine position. There is limited published literature on the prevention of pressure ulcers in advanced illness and more research is needed to explain how pressure ulcers form in those individuals with advanced illness.</p><p class="MsoBodyText3" style="margin-right:-2px">A 2018 systematic review by Rae and colleagues evaluated the literature regarding the different types of pressure relief and their comparative effectiveness regarding pressure ulcer prevention and treatment. There were 24 randomized controlled trials and 9 systematic reviews included in the analysis. Of the 9 systematic reviews, 5 reported enough heterogeneity to allow for a meta-analysis. The included reviews showed sufficient affirmation that pressure mattresses were more effective than standard mattresses. However, the literature was inconclusive comparing the different types of pressure mattresses. The authors noted the results should be considered with caution as the majority of the studies in the systematic reviews were identified as poor quality and were under-powered. Methodological concerns were also noted in regard to poor reporting of surface description. Among the randomized controlled trials, there were confounding factors including variable frequency of repositioning between groups and the use of different mattresses. A difficulty with researching mattresses is the visible difference between the mattress types which does not allow blinding of the participants and treating clinicians. Focus on specifically comparing brands is also difficult due to the rapid changes in technology.</p><p>A 2018 prospective, non-comparative, observational study by Meaume and colleagues assessed the use of a specific alternating-pressure mattress overlay (APMO) and whether participants who were at risk of developing a pressure ulcer did so after using the APMO. There were 83 participants included in the study. None of the participants had pressure ulcer at baseline and all were considered at medium to high risk of pressure ulcer using the Braden scale. Participants were included if they sat in a chair during the day for at least 4 hours and were lying in bed between 15&ndash;20 hours per day. Participants were excluded if they had a life expectancy of less than 6 months or had signs of malnutrition. The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants who developed a pressure ulcer of at least a category II (according to the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel classification). Secondary endpoints included subject comfort and satisfaction with the APMO and safety which was analyzed by the description of adverse events. With a follow-up period of 35 days, 1 participant developed a pressure ulcer of at least a category II. This was a sacral pressure ulcer (1.5 cm in diameter) that occurred on day 21. The participant had a baseline Braden score of 12/23 and lay on the bed for 19 to 20 hours per day. Participants reported a high level of satisfaction concerning the comfort of the APMO. There were three adverse events that were considered related to the APMO; 1 participant with worsening general state of health with development of a sacral pressure ulcer (stage II) leading to drop-out at day 27, 1 participant with lower back pain who dropped out at day 4, and 1 participant with back pain caused by the APMO on a dorsal scar which led to drop out on day 1. There are several limitations to this study including the absence of a control group, what could be considered a short duration time, and potential bias with the exclusion of those with a life expectancy of less than 6 months and lack of signs of malnutrition as this population could be at particular risk of pressure ulcer. With the low incidence of pressure ulcer development, recommendations could be made for use of APMO for those who are bed confined for 15-20 hours per day.</p><p>Another study by Meaume and colleagues in 2021 (similar to the above 2018 study) reported on the benefit of using a specific alternating-pressure mattress overlay in those at medium to high risk of developing pressure ulcers. In this prospective, multicentre, observational, longitudinal study, there were 83 participants included who had a Braden scale score of 12.8&plusmn;1.6 and were lying down on average of 16.6 hours per day. None of the participants had a pressure ulcer at the beginning of the study however, 18 participants had a history of pressure ulcers. In this study, participants were lying between 15-20 hours per day on an alternating-pressure mattress overlay. The study duration was 35 days and skin condition was monitored daily for appearance of a pressure ulcer. For the primary endpoint, none of the study participants had a sacral, spine, heel or trochanteric pressure ulcer after 35 days. The secondary endpoints included category I pressure ulcer incidence or pressure ulcer of any category in any area other than the sacrum, spine, heels or trochanteric areas. Secondary endpoints also included participant satisfaction with the comfort of the mattress, acceptance of the sound level of the mattress, and safety (documented as adverse events and technical issues). On day 9, one participant developed a category I sacral pressure ulcer. There were three participants with reported adverse events; two of which were not related to the mattress and there was one technical incident reported (difficulty moving the participant to a shower stretcher due to mattress cover hanging over the mattress). While the study has limitations including the non-comparative nature and short duration of 35 days, there were no mattress-related adverse events and no participants in the medium or high-risk category developed a sacral, spine, heel or trochanteric pressure ulcer.</p><p>Marvaki and colleagues (2020) reported on a comparison study between two types of support surfaces for pressure ulcer prevention in an intensive care unit (ICU). There were 70 participants total, 35 who were placed on a support surface which used alternating pressure and active constant low pressure-continuous airflow versus 35 participants who were placed on a standard hospital therapeutic memory foam mattress. Participants also received supportive measures such as change in position every two hours, daily linen change, skin care once a day, and exudate management. Participants were assessed at enrollment and every three days afterward. Primary endpoint was the appearance of pressure ulcers after enrollment as well as the time to appearance of pressure ulcers. During the 21 days of follow-up, pressure ulcer appearance was found in 15/35 participants in the alternating pressure mattress group and 18/35 participants in the standard foam mattress group. The authors also reported on additional findings including the number of pressure ulcers at the first appearance which were 1.13 in the alternating pressure mattress group and 1.22 in the standard foam mattress group. The percentage of participants who had pressure ulcers at stage 2 or higher was 23.8% on the third day after admission and 61.1% on the sixth day with no difference between the two groups of mattresses. The proportion of pressure ulcers healed on the alternating pressure mattress group was 7.7% compared to 66.7% on the standard foam mattress. In conclusion, the authors noted use of the alternating pressure mattress in this study is recommended to prevent the development of pressure ulcers, while use of the standard foam mattress should be used in those who already developed pressure ulcers to promote the healing process.</p><p>In 2021 a Cochrane review by Shi and colleagues completed an overview of six other Cochrane reviews which assessed different types of beds, overlays, and mattresses in reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers and increasing healing. There were four reviews which focused on the use of beds, overlays, and mattresses for the prevention of pressure ulcers. The other two reviews focused on the use of beds, overlays, and mattresses for treating pressure ulcers. The authors noted reactive air surfaces may reduce the risk of pressure ulcers and may increase complete healing of ulcers.</p><p>Studies are challenging in this area, as technology varies between the support surfaces, care facilities have different programs for turning, re-positioning, and care of participants, and there are multiple factors (for example, incontinence, independence of movement in bed, general health state, co-morbid conditions, etc.) which can contribute to the risk of developing pressure ulcers.</p><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Definitions</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>Pressure Injury Ulcer (National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, 2016)<br />A pressure injury is localized damage to the skin and underlying tissue usually over a bony prominence or related to a medical or other device. The injury can present as intact skin or an open ulcer and may be painful. The injury occurs as a result of intense and/or prolonged pressure in combination with shear. The tolerance of soft tissue for pressure and shear may also be affected by microclimate, nutrition, perfusion, co-morbidities and condition of the soft tissue.</p><p>Pressure Injury Stages</p><p>Stage 1 Pressure Injury: Non-blanchable erythema of intact skin<br />Intact skin with a localized area of non-blanchable erythema, which may appear differently in darkly pigmented skin. Presence of blanchable erythema or changes in sensation, temperature, or firmness may precede visual changes. Color changes do not include purple or maroon discoloration; these may indicate deep tissue pressure injury.</p><p>Stage 2 Pressure Injury: Partial-thickness skin loss with exposed dermis<br />Partial-thickness skin loss with exposed dermis. The wound bed is viable, pink or red, moist, and may also present as an intact or ruptured serum-filled blister. Adipose (fat) is not visible and deeper tissues are not visible. Granulation tissue, slough and eschar are not present. These injuries commonly result from adverse microclimate and shear in the skin over the pelvis and shear in the heel. This stage should not be used to describe moisture associated skin damage (MASD) including incontinence associated dermatitis (IAD), intertriginous dermatitis (ITD), medical adhesive related skin injury (MARSI), or traumatic wounds (skin tears, burns, abrasions).</p><p>Stage 3 Pressure Injury: Full-thickness skin loss<br />Full-thickness loss of skin, in which adipose (fat) is visible in the ulcer and granulation tissue and epibole (rolled wound edges) are often present. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. The depth of tissue damage varies by anatomical location; areas of significant adiposity can develop wounds. Undermining and tunneling may occur. Fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage and/or bone are not exposed. If slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue loss this is an Unstageable Pressure Injury.</p><p>Stage 4 Pressure Injury: Full-thickness skin and tissue loss<br />Full-thickness skin and tissue loss with exposed or directly palpable fascia, muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage or bone in the ulcer. Slough and/or eschar may be visible. Epibole (rolled edges), undermining and/or tunneling often occur. Depth varies by anatomical location. If slough or eschar obscures the extent of tissue loss this is an Unstageable Pressure Injury.</p><p>Unstageable Pressure Injury: Obscured full-thickness skin and tissue loss<br />Full-thickness skin and tissue loss in which the extent of tissue damage within the ulcer cannot be confirmed because it is obscured by slough or eschar.&nbsp; If slough or eschar is removed, a Stage 3 or Stage 4 pressure injury will be revealed. Stable eschar (i.e. dry, adherent, intact without erythema or fluctuance) on the heel or ischemic limb should not be softened or removed.</p><p>Deep Tissue Pressure Injury: Persistent non-blanchable deep red, maroon or purple discoloration<br />Intact or non-intact skin with localized area of persistent non-blanchable deep red, maroon, purple discoloration or epidermal separation revealing a dark wound bed or blood filled blister. Pain and temperature change often precede skin color changes. Discoloration may appear differently in darkly pigmented skin.&nbsp; This injury results from intense and/or prolonged pressure and shear forces at the bone-muscle interface.&nbsp; The wound may evolve rapidly to reveal the actual extent of tissue injury, or may resolve without tissue loss. If necrotic tissue, subcutaneous tissue, granulation tissue, fascia, muscle or other underlying structures are visible, this indicates a full thickness pressure injury (Unstageable, Stage 3 or Stage 4).
