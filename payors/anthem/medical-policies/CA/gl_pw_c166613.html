It is a part of the lymphatic system, which plays a function in combating infections in the body. Additionally, the adenoids may also act as reservoirs for bacterial infections, contributing to recurrent infections of the sinuses, throat (pharyngitis), or middle ear.</p><p>Adenoids may enlarge when actively involved in fighting an infection. Chronic enlargement, referred to as adenoid hypertrophy, can result from persistent infection and in an increase of the adenoids to the size of a ping pong ball. This enlargement may prevent airflow through the nasal passages, or obstruct airflow such that breathing through the nose requires excessive effort. This may contribute to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).</p><p>Adenoidectomy has been widely accepted and proven to be an effective treatment for children with medically refractory chronic adenoiditis with rhinorrhea or chronic rhinosinusitis, otitis media with effusion, and obstructive adenoid hypertrophy resulting in obstructive sleep apnea (Burns, 2017; Lieberthal, 2013; Marcus, 2012).</p><p>The use of adenoidectomy for the treatment of otitis media (OM), either acute (AOM) or with effusion (OME), has been a focus of investigation for many years. One area of concern is the use of this procedure, with or without the use of tympanostomy tubes, in the treatment of OM in children under 4 years of age. Several large, well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have published a mix between no benefit and only small benefits reported. Of the studies reporting no benefit, the use of tympanostomy tubes was included in the study protocol (Casselbrant, 2009; Hammaren, 2005; Koivunen, 2004; Mattila, 2003). The studies that did report some benefit, tympanostomy tubes were used in two (Kujala, 2012; MRC, 2012), but not in a third (Paradise, 1999). An international consensus on management of OME in children specifically stated that adenoidectomy is not recommended for children under 4 years of age (Simon, 2018).</p><p>The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) updated their guideline for treatment of otitis media with effusion in 2016 (Rosenfeld, 2016). This update specifically recommends against the use of adenoidectomy for the treatment of OME in children younger than 4 years of age &ldquo;unless there is distinct indication (eg, nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis) exists other than OME&rdquo;. AAO-HNS had previously recognized some indications for adenoidectomy to treat OME in younger children. The change is based on systematic review data (Boonacker, 2014; Mikals, 2014) showing no difference in the rate of repeat tympanostomy tube insertion between children younger than 4 years old treated with primary adenoidectomy compared to tympanostomy tube insertion alone as the primary procedure.</p><p>The AAO-HNS guideline also changed their position on the use of adenoidectomy only as a second line treatment after failure of an initial trial of tympanostomy tubes. The updated recommendation suggests that adenoidectomy should be considered a first-line therapy along with, or as an option to tympanostomy tube insertion. As with the previously mentioned change, this recommendation is based on recent systematic review data (Boonacker, 2014; Mikals, 2014; Wallace, 2014). However, the data supporting this change are weak. Most notably, the Boonacker study does not address adenoidectomy as a primary procedure. The only support for primary adenoidectomy comes from the Mikals study which states:</p><p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:52px">When studies were limited to level 1b quality data, only 5 studies met inclusion criteria. In these studies, the pooled estimate of the rate of repeat T Tubes for children undergoing a primary adenoidectomy was 20.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.2% to 31.6%) vs 34.1% (95% CI, 13.2% to 54.9%) for children undergoing primary T Tube only.</p><p>These results are not provided with p-value data, and with such significant overlap of confidence intervals, the value of primary adenoidectomy is questionable.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute otitis media (Lieberthal, 2013) states: &ldquo;Adenoidectomy alone should not be used for prevention of AOM but may have benefit when performed with placement of tympanostomy tubes or in children with previous tympanostomy tube placement in OME.&rdquo; Note that this statement is equivocal, in that they say it &ldquo;may&rdquo; be of benefit for AOM. However, the available data from RCTs does not support this statement.</p><p>In 2022, the AAO-HNS published an update to their clinical practice guideline addressing the use of tympanostomy tubes in children (Rosenfeld, 2022). The guideline offers an option in Statement 11 that adenoidectomy may be performed &ldquo;as an adjunct to tympanostomy tube insertion for children with symptoms directly related to the adenoids (adenoid infection or nasal obstruction) or in children aged 4 years or older to potentially reduce future incidence of recurrent otitis media or the need for repeat tube insertion.&rdquo; The authors acknowledged a moderate to low level of evidence supporting this statement. This statement reflects that the expected benefit of adjunctive adenoidectomy is only a potential. Prospective randomized trials are needed in order to determine whether adjunctive adenoidectomy provides a net health benefit compared to tympanostomy tube insertion alone.</p><p>Published evidence does not support the use of adenoidectomy with or without tympanostomy tubes in children under the age of 4 years of age who have chronic OM with effusion or recurrent acute otitis media.</p><p>The use of adenoidectomy is widely accepted to be an effective treatment for suspected adenoid tumor. While there is little clinical trial evidence to support this procedure, the removal of malignant tissue is the standard of care in most head and neck cancers (NCCN, 2023).</p><p>Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a frequent indication for adenoidectomy in children and is characterized by disturbances in breathing pattern or efficacy during sleep. Unfortunately, there is no widely accepted standard for the diagnosis of SDB. However, common definitions of SDB may involve snoring, mouth breathing, and pauses in breathing (apnea). Daytime symptoms associated with SDB may include excessive sleepiness, inattention, poor concentration, aggression, depression, hyperactivity, and wetting the bed. A wide array of obstructive disorders may result in SDB, ranging in severity from simple snoring to obstructive sleep apnea. The most common cause of SDB in children is tonsillar hypertrophy, which is an abnormal enlargement of the tonsils, including the adenoids. This may be due to chronic infection or excess tissue growth. Physicians may diagnose SDB based on an individual&rsquo;s medical history, physical examination, audio/video taping, pulse oximetry, or limited or full-night polysomnogram, also known as a sleep test. History and physical examination are the most common initial methods for diagnosis. Treatment may involve antibiotics to address underlying infection, but if such treatment fails or is not indicated, tonsillectomy may be warranted.</p><p>In children less than 3 years of age, behavioral issues related to SDB may be more difficult to identify (for example, they may not yet be continent and, as such, enuresis would not necessarily be a sign of SDB). In addition, access to diagnostic polysomnography may be difficult and the results may be less reliable. Based on additional clinical input from specialists in the field, it would be appropriate to consider adenoidectomy when a parent or caregiver reports regular episodes of nocturnal choking, gasping, apnea, or breath holding which have persisted for several months in the setting of documented adenoid hypertrophy.</p><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a major subset of SDB. Individuals with OSA suffer from redundant soft tissue in the pharynx, including the adenoids and tonsils, which blocks the upper airway leading to periodic cessation of breathing. Individuals with OSA must change sleep position or increase their respiratory effort to overcome the blockage, disrupting sleeping patterns. Symptoms of OSA may include nocturnal gasping, cyanosis, excessive daytime sleepiness, pulmonary hypertension, and snoring, to name just a few. The diagnosis of OSA in children has not been standardized, although there is some consensus that a threshold of greater than one on the AHI is an indication of OSA (Au, 2009; Chan, 2004; Spruyt, 2012). The AAP regards adenoidectomy as a reasonable option for any child with documented OSA and adenoid hypertrophy (2012; Marcus, 2012).</p><p>Byars and others (2018) conducted a population-based cohort study of 1,189,061 children. Participants included both controls and those who underwent adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, and adenotonsillectomy in Denmark between 1979 and 1999. Data for these participants were linked to national registers up to 2009, covering at least the first 10 and up to 30 years of life. There were 17,460 participants who underwent adenoidectomy, 11,830 who underwent tonsillectomy, and 31,377 who underwent adenotonsillectomy. The control group included 1,157,684 participants who did not undergo these procedures. The authors reported that &ldquo;adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy were associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in diseases of the upper respiratory tract (relative risk [RR], 1.99; 95% CI, 1.51-2.63 and RR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.54-4.80; respectively).&rdquo; Smaller increases in risks for infectious and allergic diseases were also found, including that adenotonsillectomy was associated with a 17% increased risk of infectious diseases (RR, 1.17), corresponding to an absolute risk increase of 2.14%. They concluded by suggesting, &ldquo;it is important to consider long-term risks when making decisions to perform tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy.&rdquo;</p><p>The majority of authoritative recommendations and research-based literature addressing adenoidectomy are focused on pediatric populations. This is primarily due to the fact that there are unique characteristics of pediatric anatomy that may predispose to certain conditions. However, there may be some circumstances where adenoidectomy alone may be a reasonable course of treatment in older individuals, such as when hypertrophic adenoid tissue causes airway obstruction or when chronic adenoiditis is symptomatic.</p><table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:100%">	<tbody>		<tr>			<td class="head_stripe" width="100%"><strong>Definitions</strong></td>		</tr>	</tbody></table><p>Acute otitis media (AOM): A middle ear infection characterized by the rapid onset of signs and symptoms of inflammation (for example, pain) in the middle ear.</p><p>Adenoidectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the adenoids.</p><p>Adenoiditis: A condition characterized by inflammation of the adenoids.</p><p>Adenoids: a mass of lymphatic tissue situated at the back of the nasal cavity, in the roof of the nasopharynx, where the nose blends into the throat.

In some cases, respiratory effort-related arousals (or RERAS) are included in the RDI value.
